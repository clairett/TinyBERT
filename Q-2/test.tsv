I loved this bag , up until both of the side zippers failed . With as much as the bag cost , you think they would not have used poor quality plastic zippers in the construction . It 's the only Baggallini that has ever failed me I 've had several , and also the only one I 've bought with the cheap zippers . Avoid this bag ! Look for ones made with metal zippers .	0
I am a longterm user of the other interdental brushes made by this company . I have a couple of tight spaces and must use the slender cylindrical sizes . I thought that these would be convenient to keep in my purse or carryon for travel in addition to home use . I find that the brush is ineffective , both due to its size and due to the fragile , easily broken wire that connects the brush to the little flat handle . When I use it I do n't feel as if I have gotten the spaces as clean as they could be . On occasion I will follow use with a GoBetweens made by the same company cleanser the thin size brush . Sometimes I remove additional particles that are obvious and were missed by the Soft Pick . Even if I do n't notice any additional debris , my teeth and gums feel cleaner and more stimulated after using the GoBetween . None of these products are a substitute for flossing . They are an important adjunct . I will not buy these again .	0

This case pops against my white phone . The stand is so fitting into the back that when you are n't using it , it 's hard to know it 's there . I love using the stand so that I can use my phone to teach me piano lessons from youtube . It sits right on my keyboard and wo n't move .	1

the page for choosing seats for reserved seating theaters has a lot of glitches and bugs . it does n't allow me to select two available seats together , only one at a time . then i have to make another transaction to try and buy the seat next to the one i just bought but it will not allow me to do that either , even though the seat is available . the error message always says my seat selection is invalid when it clearly says it 's available . this has happened to me three separate times and always resulted in buying more tickets than i need that are scattered all over the theater then having to make a long trip to the theater to straighten it all out . by that time , the seats i really want are already gone ! it is a huge inconvenience and wastes a lot of my time and money ! please fix this !	0

I use a safety razor to shave and get occational cuts . This thing makes my cuts sting , so i know it works . I also use a electric razor when i do n't have time to wet shave and my neck gets red . It stops the bleeding for cuts and cures my redness pretty well and i think it will lasts me forever .	1

I have used wax strips before , so I did n't think it would be painless , but this was horrific ! The wax is so gummy that it wo n't pull off quickly and cleanly . It tugs and sticks . Also , the included wipes are useless . They are like wax paper with oil on them . I tried to use one , and it was even more of a mess than the wax was . I will go back to using the Sally Hansen brand .	0
these cables are really nice . they are about 55 inches long not including the connectors at the end . i bought them from amazon as the seller so i think they are real . the quality seems very nice . hopefully , they will last .	1

The construction of this is rather like what you would expect from a roadside stand that sells tourist items for suckers . The seller promises sizing , but the product arrived with an internal straw structure sized about for a 3year old . Basketry is loose and constructed of tired , very thin straw . .	0
OK , where to start ? I am not much overweight anymore since I began juicing 2 years ago and lost about 50 pounds and KEPT it off since . But since a recent heart attack I figure another 20 pounds would n't hurt . So I see this available to try out in the Vine Program figure what the heck , try it ! First thing I notice is the ingredients are NOT shown in the Amazon description . Product arrives and I look at all these alien to me ingredients . Then I go to a website called drugs dot com . I log ALL my medications there since it helps me to not mix any dangerous combo of medications that may kill me with my heart lung blood clots in right lung problems etc . What do I find ? Not a single drug used in this formulation is even KNOWN at this site ! So I really feel suspicious at this point and use Internet searches for every ingredient . Everywhere I turn , it smells funny and vague to me .So my review . I expect Amazon to kick me out of their Vine Program soon since I am finding more more that products I try from them SUCK ! Plain simple , that 's right , I said SUCK . . . . . Not any reflection or complaint of Amazon , I rarely shop from any other source ! But take this product . I begin my review and thought , well , maybe I better read what everyone else thinks first ? Now , I NEVER do this but since MY experience with this product is so weird I figured I had better check 1st . I do n't like to do this as I am afraid it may taint my own reviews . Anyway , I read the only 3 prior reviews . Guess what ? They ALL sound like infomercials endorsing this product ! I mean , you have GOT to be kidding me ! ! ! ! If I am wrong , I am sorry but c'mon . Each reviewer is from the same location as the product manufacturer which is Greenwich , CT 06830 USA . Next , they are ALL written a week apart in the same month year . Coincidence ? Then , I notice all THREE of these reviewers have ONLY reviewed the products from Homeostasis Labs . Now I really do n't think my suspicions of this products SCAM reviews is simply a result of my many years spent working for the Police Department anymore , I think this Company requires CAREFUL consideration before you buy their product folks . Every alarm in my head just screams at me saying , uh , sure , anything you say . . . .In other words , are you KIDDING me ? The above is background and why I feel very uncomfortable with this product . And maybe I would never have investigated any product so carefully if it were n't a SAFETY issue for me considering all the dangers involved with me mixing medications as it is no less than life threatening for ME to do otherwise . So you need to know how did this product work ? For ME ? Well here it is folks , MY result is I am MORE hungry . Find myself eating more than usual . Why ? NO idea , it is just I am more hungry than usual . The taste of the pills is nondescript . A very slight taste of something that reminds me of a sugar substitute but just not sure . Not completely repulsive , but a definite aftertaste that lingers and I do NOT care for it . The box is a gimmicky DUMB design unlike another reviewer touts as cute It is also an extreme WASTE of resources to package this in such a large and double box as well . NO cravings have been diminished , I do NOT feel better in ANY way , And are you ready for the REAL shocker ? I do n't look any better either ! Oh well , I tried . . . . .If anyone out there is legit and has any good result from this and it is n't all in their head , good for you . Myself , I smell a scam , pure simple , given the first 3 reviews and location of reviewers as mentioned earlier . If wrong , my apologizes to the 3 1st reviewers , but PROVE ME WRONG ! Oh , and give me a break will ya ? I mean , we are n't ALL idiots people . . . . . .Every human beings body is different . Maybe this will work for you ? Not me . And I am simply uncomfortable with ANY product that has listed ingredients that can not be judged by a pharmacist on safety to use with my prescription medication . Remember , a lot of folks actually DIE from over the counter medications . This may be as safe as a good nights sleep ? Maybe not . All I know , is nobody can tell ME if it is safe or not when mixed with my medication . You also are supposed to take 2 of these pills , three times per day . So that will COST you as there are only 50 pills in a box . So 6 pills a day , 50 pills in a box ? ? ? ? ? Who did THAT math when designing this product ? I mean really . . . .8 1 / 3 days worth in a purchase ? I 'm sorry folks , I just do n't get this product . Not at all !	0

Sssuuuuuppppeeerrrr nice place ! ! They have free popcorn as well as other refreshments . The people who work there are absolutely wonderful . My sister 's engine went out on our way to Arizona and we were stranded in New Mexico for a few days . They helped us greatly throughout the whole experience . Helped with the rental and fixed the car no problem . If you 're looking for great service look no further . We ca n't thank them enough for the great service they 've provided .	1

Respectful albeit unprofessional dealership , have a great relationship with South Shore BMW and figured we would get a MINI Clubman for a company car . Dealership turned out to drag their feet after taking a deposit and then decided not to proceed they blamed corporate but we called for clarification and learned it was just dealer discretion . Had they acknowledged the issue from the getgo , it would have been what it was , but we were misled and employee would not admit to this , choosing to blame corporate instead .	0

These cases look very nice , go together on the phone easily , but snugly and the double layer design and the fact it keeps the camera lense and main screen from striking the ground directly when the phone is dropped cause me to give it a solid five stars and a buy recommendation . I bought one blue , one burgandy and two black versions for the Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphones we own .	1

i 'm kind of upset . i purchased 10 tickets for iron man 3 at a local theater ( regal ) . i went to pick the tickets up at theater and when they printed a message said this showing has been cancelled . i am upset that the showing was cancelled . i am upset that it seems fandango is aware since they no longer list that showing . i am upset that no one from fandango saw fit to make a customer aware that a purchase they made was no longer valid . if i had n't picked the tickets up early , luckily in this case weeks in advance , i would have had 9 very upset friends on thursday , may 2nd . i am aware that the theater are the ones who cancelled the showing , but fandango was who i bought the tickets from . fandango was made aware of the change and you made no effort to inform the customer . i am extremely disappointed in my experiences during this transaction . i would have also been out approx 140 the charge was put through on my card despite the showing being no longer on any schedule .	0
Kent Patterson was a pleasure to work with in choosing a new car and his assistant was also . They did all they could to insure that I was happy with the car .

These reviews ca n't be real ! I started off by trying to compare this dealerships offer with another dealerships offer . The internet salesperson stated they could beat the offer . I then gave them most of the numbers from the other dealership and the internet service person never called me back . I then received another call from a sales rep whom was also declaring to be an internet sales rep but she had no idea how to answer the questions so she kept putting me on hold to ask someone else questions about the vehicle I inquired about online .	0
This a a Great Sweeper . Problem is it 's my third one in 5 years . For 35 to 45 I was willing to deal with the short battery life and cringe guiltily when I tossed it into a dumpster . But this time it only lasted a month and a half .The manual instructs you to , initially , charge the sweeper , uninterrupted , for a minimum of 16 hours . They note that the indicator light will illuminate when properly connected and will NOT turn off when fully charged . Fine . I charged it overnight but the indicator light was off in the morning . What ? ! So I moved it to another outlet and plugged it in again . The light went off within a couple of hours . I moved it to another outlet8230 Same thing . Funny thing everything else I plug into these outlets works just fine . I finally gave up and decided that 2 days of charging was more that enough despite their wonky indicator light .I used the sweeper daily for about 5 weeks . It was wonderful but got weaker and weaker . You 're not supposed to recharge until the battery is fully exhausted . MAJOR INCONVENIENCE . I finally turned it on , flipped it over , and let the brush rotate until the motor stopped . This took an irritatingly loud 20 minutes . They also note 34The power with must be in the OFF position when charging .34 HUGE PROBLEM there is NO 34On34 or 34Off34 position It 's just a button that pushes in and pops out . I realized after I plugged it in to recharge that I did n't remember if I had pressed the button again to turn it off . REALLY ? ! This is supposed to be a tool to help make my life easier not a second job .After 3 days of charging with the indicator light repeatedly turning off I tried to use it and it would n't operate at all . There are instructions indicating that you may need to recharge and exhaust it repeatedly to keep the battery functioning . This is just too much work for any household tool ! ! Especially one that is out of commission for 2 or three days at a time as you try to charge it .Fix the battery and I will purchase again .	0

This is my 4th portable power pack long story and I think it 's my new favorite .The big thing is the integrated power cord . Every other power pack has required me to carry a separate cable which , even if it 's a retractable , is still one more thing to have stuffed in my pocket . The size is perfect , being about the same dimensions as a smartphone . It 's only 4000 mAh , putting it a little on the mediumsmall side of power packs but that 's still enough to charge most phones 3 times . It 's also light weight attn bikers , hikers , joggers .I do worry about what happens if that cable wears out . I 've found quite a lot of USB cables start to separate after just a few months . This one looks better constructed with the cable head being fully enclosed , so hopefully it wo n't pull apart like the others but only time will tell if this review is more than a few months old then apparently it 's still doing okay because otherwise I 'd come back to update this review ! It does have a second power output slot , though , which takes a regular USB cable included in box so if the main cable does go bad , you 've still got that secondary slot . You can also charge two things at once if you carry that additional cable around with you .You'll still need a cable to recharge it but that 's fine at least I do n't have to carry around with me all day .I like my old Energizer power pack too , but it 's short and fat a bit too bulgy for a jeans pocket and while the magnetically attached cable on it was cool , it 's not as cool or convenient as the integrated cable in this Motorola pack .Solid win here . Edit Also works well with my Kindle Fire . Went to do some reading at lunch today and realized I 'd let my Fire run down to 6 power . Plugged this charger into it and went on my merry way , reading while it charged .	1

I moved to beautiful Tennessee about 7 years ago and along with that move came not so beautiful sinus headaches . My doctor told me that TN is one of the worst places to live as far as allergies go . I tried daily allergy meds , a nettie pot and other basics to get rid of the headaches . Most worked to a certain extent . I read about Panaris oil and decided to give a bottle a try . I 'm so happy with it . I use about 1 / 4 of a dropper in each nostril at night the instructions say to use 1 / 2 dropper full in each nostril and so far I have n't woken up with a single sinus headache . This stuff is like a true miracle for me . My husband started using it a few days ago too after hearing me rave about it and he likes it too . He only uses twofour drops in each nostril . The bitter taste can be shocking at first , but it 's worth it for me and only lasts for a minute or two after using . I just purchased three more bottles , so my husband can have his own and so we do n't run out !	1

( i used to work for nordstrom and know this is easy to do . ) all i hope now , is that there is eventually resolution to this and i am not out the money i spent for a gift card that has not arrived .	0
There is some problem with UPS delivery . I personally do n't like the idea of delivering the package at the front door . But Amazon did an excellent job by sending replacement .

Good for travel and of course it is Samsonite ! ! !	1
i was given a gift card to fandango and tried using it tonight . i started by downloading the app and trying to make a purchase there , which failed . next i went to the website , error again , finally i tried the phone could n't use a gift card . i wanted to tickets to this is 40 for 8 . 75 . so i call the customer service number , of course could n't just make the purchase over the phone . . . after a 26 minute phone call and my card being ' unlocked ' when i am finally able to try to purchase tickets again , the price had went up ! very inconvenient and frustrating and i will spread the word that these cards are not customer friendly . very disappointing .	0

I wore these shoes for the first time yesterday and was really very impressed with them . I had to sprint across a busy highway at one point and felt like I was bouncing along . I am used to the negative heel and wore them for about 7 hours . I would suggest that you go slowly if you are wearing this type of shoe for the first time . Another thing I noticed was the stability which is lacking in a lot of this type shoe . The sole is not so high and arched that it is unstable .	1

I have always used a manual toothbrush in the past and this was my first experience with an electric . I had always been concerned about electric brushes being complicated and not much of an improvement over their manual cousin , however , my fears were quickly allayed as I found the Oralb 3000 to be a fast and easy setup . I also was n't prepared for the kind of clean a electric brush would bring over a manual . My teeth feel much cleaner and I even find myself looking forward to brushing now . I brush more often and for longer with the Oralb . I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use electric brush .	1

I bought it as a ' thank you ' gift for my friend . It took forever , and I would have returned it , but my friend was too polite to tell me it did n't fit until much later when she lost her phone , and I said did n't the color make it easier to fine . She was embarrassed to say it did n't fit and never was able to use it .	0
It all started out as an alright experience . Nice staff , decent communication . Seemed to be solid and straight to the point . Well , i guess it was n't afterall . We simply requested gap insurance in the discussion of our car deal . Since there was a reasonably large down payment provided , we were ensured that gap is not needed . The are you sure ? I feel more comfortable with gap still question was asked again of course , but again we were told no no it really wo n't be needed with that down payment and in the most ensuring and calm tone too , nothing too aggressive , so i guess we decided to believe it . Two years later and the exact thing we were told would n't happen has happened of course , and this is with a below average annual milage rate that was driven . Even when calculating the prorated refund from an extended warranty purchased in there , still , the car would be upside down . Called the dealership to try and explain this situation and possibly look for some options with the sales manager that goes by Tim . Tim took huge offense and simply would not even listen to the story as if I were completely wrong , and then proceeded to hang up on me a person who was not cursing , or yelling , or screaming , you still hang up on ? and announced he was hanging up on me by saying i am not going to go through this with you as if i was a simple little child . So not only do they talk down to you but their card that they play is to play victim as if the customer is wrong in a how dare you kind of way . Basically if things hit the fan , the script is quickly flipped to look like they 're the victim . Wow , i guess you live and you learn . We me and my fianc thought we actually had a dealership we could be loyal to and go back to time and time again , but i guess not ? We almost bought a second car from them but good thing we decided to hold off . Sad thing too that it was actually the manager that hung up on me in that way . Side note , service is okay , does what their supposed to do and straight to the point . This is all for the sales side . I suggest waiting at least a year or so depending on your situation before reviewing your experience , just to make sure whatever was promised and advised was and still remains accurate down the road .	0

I had been putting off my car purchase due to the loss of my husband a year ago . Never bought a car without him so this was a very emotional time . When I got to the dealership I was made to feel comfortable by two very friendly young men , Jared Kloempken and Jamel Gipson . I was nervous and very sad but they took care of me and assisted me with kindness . I 'm very pleased with my experience and purchase . Everyone that I dealt with at Lou Fusz was GREAT !	1

I 've taken prenatal vitamins for years my primary care doctor recommends them for any woman of childbearing age , and these are my favorite .

This is a great looking case . Offers scratch protection and some screen protection . The sides do go up a little past the lip so it will not scratch the screen if you place it face down .The only problema big oneis that it breaks easily .

Watch battery lasted 4 years but there are FOUR batteries to replace .Overall , a great adventure watch for anyone into outdoor events . But , does just as well on any wrist for day2day wear .	1
this is the stupidest process i ' ve ever used . i buy a ticket but need to print the confirmation so i can stand in line with the other ticket buyers at the theatre to get my ticket ? and the link in the email giving instructions does n't work there 's an hour wait on your phone line . i could have just bought the tickets at the theatre where there was no line on my way home from work . if it was n't for the gift card you would n't have my business .	0
Pretty purple color looks deep and rich on my black iPhone . Case comes up and around the sides so it covers my screen protector and does n't form bubbles at the ends like some cases do . The volume button cover part kinda looks a little iffy , I mean , it does n't line up absolutely perfect . But for the cost , definitely a great buy .P . S . Shipping was so fast ! Came in a couple days after ordering , which was 2 or 3 days before estimated arrival .	1
Service department ca nt fix cardoesnt give statusWe took our Genesis in almost a month ago for warranty repairs with a problem in the electrical sensor network . It has only 20 , 000 miles on it . . It 's still there . We hear nothing . A month . We call to try to find out status and repeatedly get put on VERY lengthy holds , disconnected , rerouted from person to person to person to person , and told someone will call us right back . . which never EVER happens . When we do finally get to talk to a real person , we are only told they are still testing . Granted it is a problem with an electrical sensor network that is probably difficult to diagnose but really . . A MONTH ? ? ? ? with absolutely zero progress . . . they are unable to even tell us what they have learned is NOT the problem . We did get a loaner car which we are grateful for , but dealing with this service facility is a nightmare . VERY unprofessional .	0

My parents have used Scott tissue for years . I never liked it much when I was growing up , leaning more in favor of the cushy , expensive stuff . However , when I got out on my own and had a home with a septic system , I learned quickly that not only did Scott tissue last longer than the expensive , cushy tissue , it worked just as well and was much easier on my septic system . Now , I buy Scott on the Subscribe and Save program so I never run out !	1

All of the horror shows of a carbuying experience can be found here . I made a deal on a 2017 Passsat SE in October of 2016 . I spent over four hours at the showroom . They paid for lunch , but I do n't get paid to sit at a car dealership cooling my heels . When I asked them to match the Internet deal , they gave me a song and dance and then had me sign an agreement to purchase at the advertised price . I left the dealership with the car , assuming we had a genuine deal . Until the finance person called me back two days later because the deal fell through . Suddenly a zero down deal meant a down payment . After speaking with a couple of people , I was assured it would be worked out , and someone would call me back . I went about my business . A few days later , they are wondering why I never brought the car back to make a new arrangement . I brought it back , all right , and took my old car back . Yoyo finance , or spot delivery , is typical of unsavory dealers . The FTC has already filed lawsuits against several California dealers for such questionable practices . What surprises me is the Camelback VW and other former Van Tuyl dealerships are now owned by Warren Buffet 's Berkshire Hathaway , as part of an 8 billion deal . I expected better of Buffet , or maybe they just do n't care .	0

I ordered this on monday and received it on thursday ! Talk about fast , my concerns were the taste as I just thru a bottle away after taking one drop . The taste was sooo bad it was n't even worth it . Hopefully it will have the same affect as the bottle by botanical health labs . For some reason they are no longer selling this on amazon . I am hopeful that this brand will work as in controlling my appetite . I have lost weight using garcinia cambogia .	1
I 've used this machine to pump out more than 30 batches of supplement containing pills . To this point , I will still have problems with the machine crushing one or two pills , but overall this is n't a big issue , and I attribute it more to user error . As long as you 're paying attention , and not trying to double fill the slots , you should n't have very many problems . It 's easy to pump out 56 batches in an hour even with difficult to work with supplements while simultaneously watching TV or being otherwise distracted .It 's dishwasher friendly , and it 's a very sturdy , simple design , which leaves few opportunities for it to break . If you have a problem , you can easily snap the plastic piece off from the main section that presses the tops and bottoms together . I 've read some reviews that state that the holes are not of the right size . I admit that there are a couple of holes that are a little snug , but this can be easily fixed , and I never have a problem of having any of the capsules fall through , which to me would be a more annoying and less fixable situation .If you have a little free time and want to save a ton of money on supplements , I highly recommend this to you . If you 're looking to get into the capsule filling business with this , forget it !	1

I 've had the pinch test systems and they 're easy to use but just not that accurate when you 're trying to get the same pinch of the same location every time which you 're just not going to be able to do . As well , I just do n't have the time or money to get a professional reading . This does all of that for you in using an entirely different method to get your BMI and Body Fat . It is so simple , put in your information , turn it on , hold it and start . A few seconds later you have a reading ! As a check I did my initial test following the instructions not right when you get up , not within 2 hours of eating , etc . and then did one right as I got up and one within about 10 minutes of eating and you definitely get a drastically changed reading . Follow the instructions for use and you ca n't go wrong with a great and very easy way to track your Body Mass Index and Body Fat . I highly recommend this product .	1

The5000mAh External Backup Battery Power BankI received feels a bit too light for its size . By shinning a powerful LED flashlight through its case , I can tell that the internal battery only occupies onethird of the cavity see the picture I uploaded to ' Customer Images ' section . That makes me suspicious of its advertised ' 5000mAh ' capacity rating . So I conducted an experiment to measure its capacity .I connected a 5ohm resistor to the ' 1A ' USB port of this unit , and measured both its output voltage and current . Throughout the first one hour , the unit generated a 4 .9V 0 .96A output , which is exactly as expected . Shortly after one hour , however , the output dropped dead . This was a big surprise since I expected it to sustain the load for at least 3 hours .I recharged the battery pack again , and repeated the same test . During the second time , the output dropped dead after 66 minutes .Based on the energy delivered , I can estimate that the internal battery has a capacity of around 1800mAh . Here is how I arrived at the number Output Power 4 .9V 0 .96A 4 .7W Total energy delivered 4 .7W 1 .1hour 5 .2Wh Assuming the power conversion from 3 .7V to 5V is only 80 efficiency , the energy stored in internal battery 5 .2Wh / 0 .8 6 .5Wh Current capacity of battery 6 .8Wh / 3 .7V 1 .75AhTherefore this socalled ' 5000mAh ' power bank contains just a 1800mAh battery . I hate falsely advertised products . This unit is going back for a refund .Just for comparison , I also tested thePowerAdd 2600mAh Power Bankwith the same setup . It was able to sustain 4 .8W output power for 1 .55 hours . That means its internal battery is about 2500mAh according to my calculations . The PowerAdd unit is smaller , cheaper , and even comes with a detachable LED flashlight module .Update on Oct 1 , 2013I purchased another similarlooking product Poweradd 5000mAh External Backup Battery and repeated the same test . Battery capacity of Poweradd unit was determined to be around 4400mAh , which is 2 .4 times higher than this noname ' 5000mAh ' unit .	0

My 5yo son ate way too many cookies and drank way too much chocolate milk at kindergarten one day . He came home and said he was n't feeling well so we gave him a bucket and put towels down all around his bed . At one point , he realized he was going to throw up so he thought it was best to get up and walk around . Of course , as a result he ended up creating a gigantic brown stain on our new light beige carpet , no where near the bucket or towels ! Anyway , we tried several different carpet cleaning solutions , including another Resolve product . We were unable to make the stain unnoticeable so with my wife freaking out , I decided to see if I could find something else to try . I bought this after reading the reviews and although the stain is not gone completely , this product made it almost disappear enough that my wife is no longer asking me to replace the carpet .Overall , I could n't expect a better result . This will be my goto stain remover for the next accident .	1

I LOVE this shirt . I 've bought about five flannel shirts this season , and this one is by far my favorite . The material is super soft , the style is cute with the buttons on the back giving it a nontraditional flannel shirt look , the sizing is accurate . . . . Everything about it is wonderful . The ruby red is beautiful . As one reviewer mentnioned , it IS a thin flannel shirt , so if you want something on the heavy side , this is not the one for you . I would definitely buy it again .	1

I have had a beard for decades now , and although I have worked my way through a few electronic beard trimmers in my time they always break eventually I generally go lowtech . There is little that ca n't be accomplished with a regular razor and a pair of scissors . I have never even tried an electric razor before . They are usually too expensive , and I have always heard that they do n't work as well as the tried and true razor .So when I got this Philips Norelco QS6140 / 41 Styleshaver I was skeptical but wanted to give it a shot .It 's fantastic . The myth of the electric razor is just a myth , and I was shocked at how close a shave I got with this Styleshaver . My wife was joking that , first the first time in our marriage , my face was smoother than hers is . And it is so easy . Which is n't to say it was magic . They shaver was definitely uneven , and I had to look close to go over some spots again , but for ease of use it is worth it . Consider me sold on the electric razor .What I love about this Styleshaver in particular is that it is a multitasker . I do n't have epic amounts of storage space in my bathroom , which is already chock full of electric toothbrushes , contact supplies , glasses cases , and other daytoday maintenance items . There is no way I could fit in both an electric shaver and an electric beard trimmer . Having this combo device is perfect . This is one of those clever ideas I am surprised is n't universal . Beard trimmer and sculptor on one end , foil shaver on the other . Just flip it around . And I loved the rotating head that gave you a finetuner along with a big flat shaver .I also appreciate the charging stand . This is another thing that usually takes up space , but the Styleshaver stand is tiny , yet sturdy . It fit right on the counter , and having a charger means I do n't have to worry about batteries like I do with my nose hair trimmer . A nice bonus .All in all , I give big thumbs up to the Styleshaver . It is n't perfect , and if you are finicky you might want to stick with the regular razor , but as a day to day maintenance advice it lets me be just a little bit more lazy . And is n't that what electronics are for ?	1

These bags brag about being .7 mil . thick , but purport to be fairly sturdy . A shopper also gets a lot of bags in a boxbut how many bags does one want to use to make enough thickness to do the job ? Also , while appearing dark described as brown / black in many layers , when the bag is opened to fill , it is easy to see the contents , similar to the palest sunglasses . I do not want my garbage to be that visible at the point of discard . It is nobody 's business how many eggshells , how much kitty litter , and what brand of personal products are cycling through my house . The corners of empty cardboard boxes also readily pierce the bag . Finally , there is no drawstring , which is a fairly common amenity on garbage bags , these days . When one reaches for a dark bag that is 30 inches by 36 inches , one expects it to hide the garbage , be sturdy enough to carry to the curb or dumpster , and hopefully be tough enough to be secure if it is full of trash and has to sit alongside the big can until the truck comesbesides not advertising our latest purchases . If this bag is full , it is too heavy to be secure . The only thing I can imagine not breaking a full bag is a fluffy comforter . 34One and done34 is not going to be the motto for this bag . A user will have to make a decision every time one is usedhow many is going to enough , and how am I going to wrestle the multiple bags into each other to get the security needed ?	0

I purchased this mostly for the wetshave capability and mostly use the trimmer . Despite the excited reviews of other users I do not have the illusion that this even remotely comes close to a bladedshave . . . for it does not . I have thick facial hair and this does create a smooth shave when excessively going over the same location for what seems like an eternity probably 1020 passes , but not as smooth as I get from 23 passes with a Mach3 blade . . . and I have shaved both wet and dry the dry gets closer .As I stated , I mostly use the trimmer . I do not like the irritation of hair growing back after a smoothshave , so I just trim it down . . . the last Panasonic I owned lasted for almost a year before the trimmer started having problems using maybe once or twice a week . I have used this maybe once every 2 weeks and I 'm already having troubles with the trimmer after 3 months of lightuse . It makes a highpitch noise and does n't cutforcrap . I reset it put the trimmer back in and popitout and no change , I rinse it . . . no change , I flick it . . . still no change . Sometimes I shake it and it starts working again for a second or two before it makes the highpitch noise and stops working again . I popped the compartment off like when you clean the blades and the trimmer started working again , but I 'm afraid to use it with those exposedblades as soon as I put that part back on it stops working again . It did n't have this problem before being used in wetconditions , but now it does n't want to work in the shower . I am obviously very upset that this item did not even last 3 months for the price I paid for it .This will be the last time I purchase a Panasonic . If this were a 50 electronicrazor I would 've given it 2 stars , but since I paid nearly 200 for this , it only gets 1 star because nothing that expensive should last less than a year .	0

DO NOT go here to buy your next car ! The staff is incredibly lethargic , your time is not important to them . It took over 4 hours to purchase a car and drive off the lot , something I 'm told should only take 2 . They were late to every appointment I made with them , and frequently unavailable when trying to contact by phone . Response times were also quite slow . I am also still waiting to receive paperwork from them so I can register the new car . I was told the paperwork would arrive within 10 business days , it has been 14 and still no paperwork .

This is from my Yelp reviewWe were experiencing some overheating issues and the cooling fan would come on every time we turned the car off no matter how far we drove it . We brought our vehicle in on Tuesday the 13th and we were told that it was a water pump issue and the heater hosesee pics . The hose was n't covered under our warranty . The out of pocket for us was 751 and a total of 3600 . This included the diagnostic , oil change , water pump , heater hose . On Friday the service agent called and said to call back . My husband called around 4 pm and was told our service agent was gone and nobody knew the condition of the car and to call back Monday . We call first thing Monday since we were concerned there were more issues . Apparently he called Friday to tell us our car was ready . I picked my car up Monday and notice immediately that it was doing the same thing . The next day I go to the service center and explain the car is doing the same thing and was told it 's normal . So I drive around town and it 's still the same . We take the vehicle in and mention that it 's the same issue and want to avoid another deductible . He calls back and informed us that it wo n't be a problem because we need a new radiator and our insurance wo n't cover it and it 'll be 1300 . We also have to pay 140 for this new diagnostic . We payed tge 140 and declined the repair and he informs us that if we cause any problems without getting this issue fixed it will void the warranty . Overall we are a little confused and bewildered by this experience . We do n't understand why we needed another diagnostic when the problem was n't addressed . It 's also strange that the form for the second time we brought it in states that the cooling fans were not running when the opposite was true . They were running all the time . At the very least we can say that their troubleshooting is inefficient and was a waste of time . I 'm not a mechanic but I can Google . I understand that water pump , thermostat , and heater hose issues are related to the radiator and that would be a good place to look too . I also know that 2012 Acadia radiators had issues and that Acadias are known for water leaks . To check everything but the radiator on a 2011 Acadia makes no sense since there is a cause and effect there . But I digress , this is the way they do things . As for their customer service I would say it 's uncomfortable . We talked to our service rep four times in person and even more on the phone but every time it was who are you and what do you want . We were n't expecting Nordstrom service but anything is nice . I purchased this vehicle a year ago primarily to transport my disabled sister around . Not relaying to anyone our car was ready on Friday and having to wait till Monday was rather inconvenient . They have a rental car section but did n't bring it up . We did n't either so I 'm not placing blame . Overall their customer service to us was nonexistent . It seemed like they were not interested in us as current customers or future customers . I know they are a business but i feel that even if there was a way to solve the issue because of a manufacturer warranty they would nt tell us or even look it up because they do nt care , its not there problem or you did nt ask . I do nt know why maybe because they have enough business or we were from Carmax ? I will say that I ca n't see the benefit of returning . They quoted us 1300 to replace the radiator with 500 labor . However , it took 2800 in labor to check for leaks which we did n't ask them to check . I 'm pointing this out since this is their wording . Customer requests check for leaks . No we said our car was getting hot and the cooling fan is running . I know it 's semantics . But it seems as if they were diagnosing the symptoms and not the problem . If the car is no different physically what confidence should I have . I would also like to point out that I am biased and have only dealt with the service department . Cars are also complex and expensive . Good luck and thanks for reading .	0

I had dislocated and broken my shoulder nearly six months ago and so after months of surgery , physical therapy etc , I got this as I am still having problems with rotator cuff injuries , pain and shoulder instability .I was very excited when I received this so quickly and made sure to read and reread the directions They ARE very straightforward and the item is not very complicated to put on . but basically it is little more than a neoprene shirtsleeve with a very , very tight chest strap .The chest strap is so tight I ordered a Med . and I 'm a 3534 chest that it just rode up under my left armpit like a boa constrictor nearly crushing me . I am quite petite and small 5'4 / 110 lbs and the side that had the sleeve thing could not be properly tightened , it did nothing and in fact within a few seconds of putting it on my shoulder was screaming in pain and begging for me to take this contraption off ! My shoulder was aching for hours after just a few minutes of wearing the thing and then taking it offIf all you have is very MILD garden variety tendonitis or a slightly sore shoulder rotator cuff or maybe someone who is prone to easily dislocated shoulder this might help . .Slightly .In now way is this a true brace or medical device that actually seems to help support the teres major or minor or have had a serious injury , I can not say that this would help you .It just does not seem to fit comfortably at all and actually pulls the affected shoulder more out of joint .	0

I have owned a number of electric razors over the years including theBraun 3Series 340S4 Wet Dry Shaver , Philips Norelco 7310 Men 's Shaving System , andPanasonic ES8103S Men 's 3Blade Arc 3 Wet / Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades , Silver , and now the the ESLT41 . I always ended up preferring the razors that were in the sub 75 range actual cost not retail price , just like this one . This particular razor was actually confiscated by my daughter for her use legs and arm pits she loved it so much .Panasonic razors typically come out on top when considering price point and quality . In this case , the 13k cycle per minute cutting rate combined with the blade system , ergonomics , and price point will likely place this in the sweet spot for most users . This particular razor can be used wet or dry , which is an important point because wet shaves , in my opinion , yield better results and makes it even more usable for women . ThePanasonic ESLT41 K Men 's 3Blade Arc 3 Wet / Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades , Black / Silverdoes not come with a cleaning system or charging stand hence the reason for lower price when compared to products like thePanasonic ES8228S Men 's Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System , Silver . In my opinion , the charging stand is not necessary and the cleaning system is a throwback to a bygone error because newer products are easily cleaned compared to the older systems . The battery will fully charge in 70 minutes at least that was my measured rate and retain the charge for weeks . As with these types of batteries , let the battery run completely down before charging the first few times . This will condition the battery and extend its like significantly . The LCD is simply fabulous and easy to read . It primarily shows the battery and cleaning status . The sonic cleaning system is simple to use just some liquid soap and water on the foilby pressing and holding power button until it initiates for 20 seconds .As for experience while shaving , keep in mind that personal preferences vary greatly . I have friends who swear by rotary heads as opposed the foil types this type . Also , this shaver has 3 blades compared to other razors and those with significant bear growth typically prefer 4 blade systems that I personally find too large . Another point with foil versus rotary head razors is irritation , which I infrequently experience but some friends experience at a far greater rate . Also , for anyone looking to get as close of a shave as with products like theGillette Fusion Manual Razor , simply forget it despite what other may say . I have never experienced as close of a shave . For many , that may take some getting used to . In my neck area for example , I often have to make repeat passes at various angles my hair will often grow in at weird angles . So , if you are really looking for a close shave , I suggest trying something along the lines ofThe Art of Shaving Fusion Chrome Collection Proglide Power Set 6 piece . Finally , if you are someone who lets your beard grow out at length before shaving , this razor , and most electric razors are not for you .I gave this razor 5 stars based on its design , quality , usefulness , and price point at the sub75 range . Advertised prices for this product will change and you will often see a 20 fluctuation .	1

I use this amino to curb my carb cravings , which are substantial . Make sure you wait 1 .5 hours after eating , and take it 30 minutes prior to eating , or it wo n't work as well . I can see a definite difference in my cravings when I use it . The difference is so pronounced that it ca n't just be in my head . I can easily walk past a box of donuts without feeling tempted without the amino , I 'd be trying to sniff the box to get my carb fixsad , but it 's actually happened .

I admit I was interested in trying out the Radiant Plastic line of Tampax tampons because of the shiny packaging ! I thought maybe it was a revolutionary new design or improvement to the already great Pearl line because the Radiants were slightly more expensive . So after trying these a few times , I have to say that there really is n't that much of a difference . I did n't know how Tampax could have improved much on the Pearl with the Radiant , and the answer is not by much . It was already a great product . However , I do appreciate the sticker closure on the wrapper because it did help me dispose of the applicator cleanly and quickly .As for the applicator , it is well designed , hard enough so that your grip wo n't slip when you push . I 've tried other brands where the plastic there was too thin , and it was hard to keep a grip on the applicator . Not fun . As for absorbency , I feel that the Radiant lasted longer without leaking than other regular tampons from other brands , but that could just be me . All I know is that there was little to no mess from using these , and disposal was simple and clean . I just do n't know if I 'm willing to pay more for the Radiants when the Pearls are just fine , especially the travel size ones . Now those are the best !	1
I ordered this dual port USB charger because my wife and I are always unplugging each others iPhones iPads to charge them . I specifically looked for one of the 2 .1 amp chargers to ensure faster charging .This one works great . I can charge two devices at once . However , a couple of things to know if you purchase oneFirst , only one of the ports is 2 .1A . The other is 0 .5A . That means that the 34NA34 port will charge about 4 times faster than the 34A34 port .Second , and very curiously , the 2 .1A 34NA34 port will not charge my iPad2 . I have n't done my research yet , but I am pretty sure that 's because the iPad 1 and iPad 2 and possibly iPhone 4 and earlier can only use the 0 .5A charger . The new iPhone 5 can use either the 0 .5A or 2 .1A port , so it works fine on either port . That works just as well for me , as I have my iPhone 5 lightning cable plugged into the 2 .1A 34NA34 port , and my old hah ! 2 years old is 34old34 iPad2 plugged into the 0 .5A 34A34 port . That way I can charge them both at the same time .The small form factor also means that this charger not only uses a single outlet , but it 's also about the same size as one of the larger square Apple chargers .Vest value of all the multiport chargers I looked at . There are lots of others that have 2 or more USB ports , but look carefully at the specs before you buy , because many of the ones I looked at were only 0 .5A ports , or could only charge using a single port at a time . Since this one can charge using both ports at the same time , and since it will work with any iOS device and should work with any other device that uses a USB charging cable , this is the handsdown best choice I found .	1

The only good thing about this case was the rubber shell . The hard plastic protectant was flimsy and of very poor quality .

The reviews are consistent only in that most are quite confusing . It would be helpful if reviewers could state what changes in their blood glucose levels they saw , and how they felt . Also , a fair trial means taking the supplement consistently , and on time . As diabetes type II is a serious chronic disease , it seems worthwhile to spend a few to carry out some careful trials of various supplements . If it helps you manage your condition , this supplement and the trouble you incur in buying and taking it , is certainly worth it ! Also if it did n't work for you , do n't automatically assume the herbal is 34junk34 ! That is nonsense and I say that as a professional biomedical scientist . Even wellrespected , thoroughlyresearched prescription products USUALLY fail to help some people . For me , this supplement in combination with bitter melon extract helped me keep my average readings 2hours postprandial in the 110 130 range , and helped lowered my A1C from about 6 .5 to 5 .1 5 .3 and this has been consistent for about five years . Before that , Actos and glypizide by themselves yielded readings typically between 150 170 . Of course , I consistently avoid simple and processed carbrich foods and so should you ! I 've tried stopping it and the daily blood sugar readings started getting less optimal after a few days . Anecdotal evidence , but good enough for me personally . Different brands may have different effects , so try a few before giving up . The top herbal authorities , such as Dr . James Duke and Dr Andrew Weil consider this herb worth a serious trial . You can find other herbs to try by reading their books . Read up , and keep an open mind .	1

My daughter gave me these earrings for mothers day , as garnets are my birthstone . And although I have many , many , garnet pieces a classic pair of garnet studs I did not own until now . The coloring is beautiful , the deep reddish brown of a quality garnet , not too orange and not too ' black ' . It catches enough light in the basket setting that it really lights up on the ear .The 6 mm gemstone size is the perfect size for my ear , not too big , but not small either . That said the post is on the longer side , this is great if one has thicker earlobes , but for me I just have to push the earring back a little past the post stop so they do n't hang forward . Speaking the post and backings , they securely fasten at the post stop , and have n't slipped backwards past it .For the great price these are an excellent value for a gorgeous garnet earring .	1

For those of us who are addicted to Lampes Berger , reed diffusers , wax tarts , and scented candles , this Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser is like a dream come true .First , the device is roughly the size and shape of a grapefruit and it can run on four AA batteries , which makes it ideal for moving from room to room . You do n't have to worry about finding an outlet , and you do n't have to worry about using flames or fire . The batteries do n't last too long if you use the LED light feature , but it 's a wonderful option to have especially during parties . If you do n't want to use batteries , there is also an option to power the unit with a microUSB connector . The connector is not included with this package , but you may already have one or more of these lying around from old chargers for cell phones or camera equipment .Add water up to the fill line scented with 35 drops of your favorite essential oil . The diffuser then sends a good , steady stream of steaming , fragrant mist into the air .The diffuser is made of translucent white plastic , which also works well to diffuse the LED light option . Pressing the button once will activate the mist and create a changing array of LED colors red , pink , violet , blue , aqua , green , yellow , white and blue . Pressing the button a second time will activate the mist and a solid LED light . Pressing a third time will activate the mist only and no light . Pressing a fourth time will turn off the device .If you spend a lot of money on fragrance delivery methods you will find this a lowcost , fun and convenient alternative .Recommended .	1

These shoes are adorable . Inexpensive , and you get what you pay for . . .no real support for your feet . But I do nt need it , nor do I mind if I am only wearing them for a short time .

Where I live we have 4 G LTE service with ATT and I am used to the speeds from what my iPhone gets on the network . The ATT service is really fast and has great down / upload speeds . I have no issue with the quality or speed of the network and find it way better and faster than my ATT home internet DSL if the packages for this were more affordable some form of unlimited that was reasonable this would be great for my home internet . However , this is more for people who are traveling and need access to the Internet when out and about like on the road for that purpose it is great , but be careful desktop OSs will eat up data with background tasks , so disable background processes mainly auto updates to ensure that you do not lose a giant chunk of data to some random update . . .The device works pretty well . It is fast and delivers great network speeds to my devices . The device is easy to setup you can do it all from the touchscreen it even has a small virtual keyboard . You can setup your network name and passphrase quickly and then just connect your devices over WiFi like normal . You can even plug in the USB cable to the computer and use this as a USB network device if the computer does not have WiFi . This makes this really useful for any type of device I did not use the plug in method , since all my devices have WiFi . You can also set it to charge from the computer over the USB in the settings you can change from network USB to power USB when plugged into a computer .The device supports dual band 5GHz for faster speeds , but enabling this will drain the batter faster . It also supports guest networks but when you only have so much data , I doubt you will share .The device has a webserver built into it so you can edit the settings from a computer if you prefer . However , I find all the stuff you care about is accessible from the touchscreen .The device also shows your data usage so you can avoid overages and keep an eye on your consumption . This is nice and makes it easy to keep on top of your data usage .The unit can charge devices as well . I thought from the name that it would rapid charge , but it seems to charge the device at a normal rate at least my iPhone5 I assumed from the name BatteryBoost . This is great when on the go and your phone gets low , but I found it to be a near trade off and that fully charging my iPhone will nearly kill drain this device , so if you do not need this device at the time it is useful to get your phone back alive .The battery on this unit is humungous I think it is the largest lithium ion battery I have seen . . . However , it does make the device last a lot longer than most , I found with two devices connected MacBook and iPhone it lasts about 10 hours or so . Most likely the battery life will differ based on settings and usage . However , it works perfect for getting a full day out of it for the most part by the end of the day I am at a place with a power outlet . Also , this device uses MicroUSB and a standard USB wall adapter , so I can just charge it using my usually USB plugs like for my iPhone .In the end this is a great device for keeping connected on the go . It works perfect and has superfast speeds . The batter lasts all day and can even give my iPhone a boost if it gets low . The ATT network is fast in my area and with the exception of a few small towns I always have full 4 G LTE and in those towns I have 3 G I have yet to run into EDGE , but have ran into dead zones . . . . This is a great hotspot device and works great .	1

Let me preface this by saying , I have been to John Finger Mazda once before when I was looking to purchase my CX5 . The sales manager that was there that day was a super nice guy even though I did not end up buying my car from them . Today I came back to John Finger to give them the chance to help my mom buy a car just like mine because she absolutely loved it . I showed up a little after they 'd already started showing her a few options . A little later on after looking at the numbers they were giving her , I realized that they were trying to sell her a used CX5 with 16 , 000 miles on it for more than I paid at Vic Bailey Mazda for my BRAND NEW car . These cars were identical . The middle man sales guy was nice and tried to work with us , but he kept asking my mom to sign his scrap piece of paper that him and the manager were working numbers on but , he would n't give a direct answer as to why he was having her do this . I should have made a bigger issue about this to begin with . After my mom said she did not want to buy their car because she thought she could get a better deal elsewhere , the middle man sales guy said Okay , no problem , but at least let my manager thank you for coming in . The manager walked in with a very aggressive attitude from the start . Then he proceeded to ask my mom why she even bothered to talk numbers with them if she did n't want to buy THEIR car . . . . the point of negotiating is with the intent to buy a car . When we realized we could not come to a deal with this guy we tried to stop taking up their time . The manager then asked why my mother signed the scrap paper if she did n't intend to buy the car . . . . like I said above I knew this was a red flag when the middle man asked this of her , BUT to try to use it to pressure her to buy the car is a huge nono . That is a terrible sales tactic . The problem was we 'd found a better deal once again at Vic Bailey Mazda and we made them aware of what we knew was fair and I truly believe this happens a lot . The guys at John Finger will admit that they can not compete with Vic Bailey , but we were attempting to give them the chance to . Long story short , do n't waste your time . Go to Vic Bailey where the deals are actually good and John Finger Mazda admits that they are too good to beat . Obviously , we are not the only ones that had an issue with this HORRIBLE sales manager .	0

I 've been let down at this motorsport multiple time across all departments . Let 's start with sales being as that is their primary function . Everytime I 've been there they use high pressure sales once you show interest in purchasing . Then you or at least I did get walked around while being told this is what you want um no what I want to is to buy what I came in for not what you make higher margin on , if you 're hurting for cash that bad pick up extra work or hey crazy idea do n't turn a ready to buy customer me into a not going to buy a motorcycle here again customer also me . So between the multiple chances and being lied to , yea not coming back . Next , let 's go to service . What started me looking at service was an incident where they were paid to do more than just change oil . They actually had to fix things that were broken , crazy right mechanics fixing things . Everything they were assigned to fix / look at I had to either do myself afterwards or is still giving me issues , on top of that they actually made unaffected locations of the motorcycle worse . This leads me to believe one of two things the mechanics are either only good for changing oil or they try to get return business by messing with other things . Speaking of changing oil that brings me to the next service issue . Upon reading the manual cover to cover fixing the issues they failed to do so , I discovered that my motorcycle has a max oil capacity of less than 3 quarts , which is weird since they charged me for 4 quarts , so I guess that are n't that good at changing oil either if they spilled more than 1 whole quart of it on the floor then charge customers for it . Last department that was kind of a let down was the general merchandise section . So far I have found everything there that 's not Temecula motorsport branded items for cheaper at other motorsports , the first example that comes to mind is a pair of street gloves Temecula motorsport price 60 chaparral motorsport 25 . This is more a reflection on the person setting prices vs the actual individuals that customers see , which I had no issue with simply due to having pretty no contact with them . The girls at the front desk who pick up the phone are kinda cute so there 's that I guess .	0

I had a great experience at Audi Brooklyn . It was my first time leasing a car So I was very nervous . I walked into Audi Brooklyn and was greeted by the receptionist . I asked her for a sales rep that was patient and knowledgeable . I had the pleasure of meeting Bianca . She went over all my options for leasing or financing . We went on a test drive and she went over everything in the car . I needed to go home and sleep on it . She did n't pressure me into making me feel like I needed to make a deal right there on the spot . All in all we made in the deal and I 'm very happy with my purchase and with Bianca . I will reccomend friends and family to work with her .	1

I guess it 's my fault not the sellers that I did n't check the label in the pictures before purchasing . But I do n't take supplements with the harmful additive magnesium stearate . The plant extract itself may be fine for all I know , but I 'm looking for one without harmful additives .The seller emailed me asking about how I liked the product , I told them that I noticed the additive after I had broken the label so I did n't bother trying to return it . Without me asking , they gave me a full refund right away . Great seller !	0

This is BY FAR the most ignorant uncaring unprofessional group of xxxxxxx in the industry . Called service department 8 times from Friday through Monday . Left 4 VM messages and TWO hand written notes by operator . KEPT ON HOLD for 28 minutes before giving up after finally getting someone to answer and ' go FIND A MANAGER to speak to ' . . . . . I ca n't FIND any managers . . . were her EXACT WORDS after trying twice . This is just a ridiculous excuse for customer service . Try finding a parking spot at this place when you arrive . Try finding a SIGN that leads you to the SERVICE DEPARTMENT . Or better yet TRY CALLING their number 855 2961861 , press ONE for service and ask to speak to someone BEFORE YOU EVER DECIDE TO SET FOOT in this place . BMW should shut this location done .

I was not in any way planning on buying anything other than a Shark steam mop . I already owned a Shark steam mop for the last five years and when it finally went kaput , I was planning on buying another Shark . When I looked for my mop now called a Euromop , Shark only really offered a new version with the double padded sides . I really was n't interested in buying new pads and everything , I was happy with my old mop and just wanted a new one exactly like it . My sister mentioned she had just bought the Hoover twink tank , so I looked it up on Amazon and it seemed to have much better reviews than the new Shark . I was n't crazy about buying Hoover , I had Hoover vaccumm cleaners in the past and they rarely lasted a full year before they fell apart . I liked Shark because of the long manufacturers warrenty , and the prooven quality since I owned a Shark steam mop AND vaccumm cleaner and they lasted me many years . I decided for the price , it was worth trying the Hoover twin tank . I 'm glad I did ! It came with three pads , which was great , I had no need to order separate pads to have extras around . I 've had my Hoover twin tank for six months now . I use it on Pergo flooring . It works better than my old Shark mop , the steam is more powerful . This is why it has a trigger on it . I was a little put off by having to hold a trigger the entire time Shark does n't have that feature , but in the end I realized that it was great to have , it does n't take much effort to hold the trigger the entire time , but it helps prevent over steaming some spots on floors that ca n't get too wet or too much steam in the seams . I also like that you can use your own solution in the tank , although with Pergo the only thing that is safe to use is Vinegar , anything with soap in it will cloud the floor and just sit on top like a residue . The vinegar helps break through any build up of other products while making the floors squeaky clean . The solution tank tends to let out a lot of cleaner even on the lowest setting , so I water down the vinegar solution in the solution tank . Another pro was the cord on the Hoover is a tad longer than the Shark , so I did n't have to unplug it in order to do my entire first floor . The pads wash up great , I 've been told with microfiber it should n't be washed with any fabric softner , it causes a build up and makes them less absorbent . Otherwise , they was up great . I 'm glad I made the switch , the true test will be if this product lasts several years like my Shark did !	1

Horrible , really really sad trashy work for 3 weeks until I really got mad at them . They were trying to pass off complete trash of work as repairs . They were trying to keep as much insurance money as possible without fixing the rear bumper of my GTI . They then painted the original black broken bumper with blue paint and thought it was funny . Bought my GTi from and was going to buy a Tiguan but will not . They finally used a new rear bumper and painted it black like they should have since the beginning .

This item seriously took about three days to arrive , and it was packaged in a padded envelope along with packaging inside the envelope . A bit stiff to use at first , but I think it 's because I have to break the case in .

I do not know if this medication is effective or not . I have n't had vitamin B12 levels checked .However , this bottle has 100 tablets . At one per day , it takes over 3 months to use up the bottle . Before I was halfway through the bottle , the tablets disintegrated because they absorbed water from the air . There is a dehydrator packet in the bottle , but , apparently , it did not work . I dried out a couple of dehydrator packets I took from other bottles , but the tablets still disintegrated . I ended up throwing half of them away .NOW brand needs to one of two things1 . Put only 30 tablets in a bottles I started noticing deterioration at about one monthOR2 .

Being type 2 diabetic carbs are pretty much my enemy . On occasion I consumer a heavy carb meal or item and wanted something to help prevent the spike in my gl . These work great in keeping my gl from spiking , considering that I take just one for a medium carb meal and 2 for a heavy carb meal .I watch my diet just needed a little extra help throughout the day .The pills are pretty large , but for me not hard to swallow because I take other supplements that are also pretty big too .Worth a try if you do n't mind the large horsepill size of these . They do n't upset my stomach either .	1
I 'm not sure whether as a supplement the quality of this particular vitamin B complex is good or not but the packaging is for sure SUBOPTIMAL , because at least one or two pills burst inside the bottle , and thus the other pills arrived and currently are covered in the powder of the ones that split open . . . . The reason I 'm rating this with 1 start is because this is the SECOND SOLARAY product for which this happens the other being Choline capsules .	0

I do not recommend this item AT ALL ! ! ! The concept behind it is that it will let you know a couple of days earlier than other , similar devices when ovulation begins . That would be a great thing , except this device was completely wrong . A couple of days before we thought ovulation would begin , my wife used this and it indicated that ovulation would not be in the next few days . She was a little bit surprised , but it 's not so odd that there would be a little variation in when ovulation occurs , so we did n't think much of it . The next day , again , it indicated that ovulation would not begin in the next several days . And the next day , too . Finally , she used one of the deviced we 'd gotten earlier and it showed that she was , in fact , already ovulating . As it turns out , that was the last day of ovulation and we nearly missed the entire windowofopportunity because of this thing .The month before , when she used it , it worked well . But that means it worked 50 of the time , which is not at all acceptable .I would never use this again well , my wife would never use it again , but you get what I mean . . . and I would not recommend it under any circumstances . Maybe this was a oneinamillion fluke , but that 's not a chance we 're willing to take .Note I just checked the other reviews to see if other people have had similar experiences . It looks like it 's worked for a little over 70 of the people . To my mind , that 's not nearly consistent enough .	0
I have worn Calvin Klein underwear for years , and as the years have gone by , I 've noticed the quality of the fabric to decline year by year .

Just sticking your hand inside , you feel a thin , flimsy fabric that is almost dareIsay ribbed , and feels rough like sandpaper . I returned these puppies .

Really disappointing . I took my F800GS to BMW long beach after a crash as I figured they 'd be the most qualified to repair it . The motorbike took a fall on the right side , cracked the fairing up , smashed the turn signal , and a few other bits and pieces . They charged around 120 to inspect the damage . I 'm sure an independent shop would have inspected for free , given that they would be making money from the repair but fine , it 's BMW , I 'm sure they 'd do a professional inspection . I get the bike back and they had missed some damage handlebars crooked , so they adjusted it there and then . I 'm a little pissed but at least it 's fixed now . A month later I take off my fairing to do the 12 , 000 mile service and 2 of the radiator mounting arms have snapped in half from the crash , one of which is part of the radiator so the whole thing will need replacing . Not only was this missed in the inspection , but also overlooked when they replaced the fairing , even though it was pretty obvious to my untrained eye , let alone their professional eyes . To add insult to injury , when they replaced the turn signal , they screwed it back into a mount that was also snapped in half ! There 's no way they just overlooked that , that 's entirely unprofessional . I will not be returning with my custom . Sean T	0

Audi OwnerAwful customer service ! I purchased 2 cars from this dealership in 2014 , a brand new Q5 and CPO A4 . I was invited to test drive the new 2018 Q5 and consider trading in my Q5 . They called and even scheduled an appointment . When I walked into the dealership it was a very cold welcome . Nobody even smiled at the front desk ! The sales rep at the front desk had no knowledge of my appointment . He was very snooty from the time I walked in ! I lost all interest in the new car after I talked to this guy ! What a change since 2014 . I had previously interacted with Fabio in 2014 who was outstanding ! But the guy no longer works there . The manager did not seem to care when I asked for him . Not even a smile ! If this is how they want to treat returning customers I refuse to do any more business here ! ! Sorry , but it was an awful experience ! ! !	0
These are cute shoes , are very very high , and I never thought about it but are made of sweater material and stretch out . I thought they would be over leather and sturdy but they were not .

I 've been using the AA battery version of the Spinbrush pro for several years . My dentist thinks I floss but I do n't . This rechargeable version is likely to save on AA battery purchases over the life of the toothbrush . The AA version requires that you frequently change the batteries or the performance drops quickly . You 're supposed to brush 2 minutes per day minimum I get AA batteries cheaply 18 to 22 cents and the rechargeable costs about 7 to 7 .50 more than the AA version . Since you need 2 batteries and replace about once per week or ten days , the rechargeable starts saving you money after about 6 months for a 20 cent battery price . Not a great savings but the convenience alone of not having to change batteries is good enough for me . Buy this if you like the Spinbrush pro . Having the brush at high speed and fully charged every time is also a major plus over the AA version . Since I 've never owned one of these , I do n't know how long they last . One woman reported that if you dry it off before returning to the base , it lasts a very long time . We 'll see . Side note I prefer the medium brush version over the soft version . Mediums are harder to find than the soft version but there out there Meijer in the Midwest has them	1

Edited 3 / 16 / 2014 Since writing my review I was contacted by a person calming to be hired by the company behind the product see comment below . If you read the comment you will see he tried to explain how the product works and apologizes about my results with the product and seems puzzled by the bloodburgers . I stand by my review but I did take his advice about the AZ guarantee . True to the comment , I filed a request to return and even though my purchase was a bit over their limit , my money was returned immediately . I still have the product and am still waiting for them to send information to send it back and will if requested . With this guarantee , I will leave it up to you to decide if it 's worth a try for you or not . Like I said in my review , mine was subjective to my experience only . Listen , I know every review of stuff you stick up your know is very subjective , so this pertains to me and my anatomy and my experience and YOU MIGHT SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE IF YOU DO NOT RELY ON THIS TO STOP YOUR SNORING .I did some research to decide if these were the thing for me . I used to use the No Snore spray which kinda helped but wore off after I went to sleep . After rattling the walls and getting the old elbow in the rib cage a few nights , I tried the strips over the nose , to no avail . I looked at the mouth insert but did n't think sticking something in my mouth and falling asleep would be comfortable or a good idea think drool pillow . So I found this product . It looked ok , I watched all the videos , read the reviews and with 50 / 50 for or against I was all like , Why Not ? Let me tell you WHY NOT ! Besides the thrill of breathing and the promise of not snoring , this product offers zilch in terms of effectiveness or comfort . I suffered for over 2 weeks , because I made myself wear this to see if I could get used to it and to see if it worked . Not only did I spend my money unwisely but I also wasted time and false hope for a product that promises you a better relationship with your bed partner .These are silicone tubes , connected by a small band to keep them as a single unit . You basically force them up your nostrils and hook them in position with the little tab just inside your nose . There are a few sizes and I tried them all . You can cut them shorter so if they are too long to fit in your nose then you can snip them with a pair of scissors . Be sure to blow your nose and get all snot , buggers , foreign objects and obstructions out of the way . You will have boogies and encrusted snot after use and they do need to be cleaned between uses . If you have a delicate nose and are prone to bleeding then you are in for some great fun as I tried to bleed out one night after shoving a little too hard to get them in position . I found that the air movement through the tubes also tended to leave my nasal cavity very dry and sensitive . Little blood buggers are a daily product with continued use . I never really got used to them causing more damage than good .I know some people have found this product helpful and have found success and can tolerate the feel . I could n't . My subjective opinion is for you to look elsewhere for snore relief .Now , I 'd like to tell you WHY YOU SHOULD REEVALUATE YOUR SNORING ! ! ! ! ! ! People snore , all kinds shape / size , ages gender races , nationalities . Please look up and read up on snoring . Snoring is natural . You need to figure out is your snore natural or is it due to something else ? I looked into my snoring issue . After many years of snoring and self treatment , I finally got checked out to see if there might be something else going on . I completed a sleep study where they found that I stopped breathing 89 times per hour and had 35 second period of apnea . Sure enough I was diagnosed with sever obstructive sleep apnea . I am now on a CPAP machine and sleeping well . Look up sleep apnea and take a simple quiz to see if you have the symptoms . You do n't have to be old , fat or broken to have sleep apnea , anyone can have it . Snoring is a symptom but not a cause . Maybe there is more to your snoring than meets the eye .Had this product worked as advertised and promised , there may have been some severe consequences from using it . So I give it 1 star because I ca n't give it zero . Do n't waste your money .	0
My husband stopped by and test drove a car , when it came down to talking numbers , it did n't work out . Ok , that 's understandable , he walked away , but not before Melissa Garcia handed him her card . Looking at the card , we flip it over , and there 's a hand with the middle finger drawn on it . Way to show professionalism , pretty stupid of her to put it on her business card . Way to represent your work place	0

If you read reviews as much as me you try to see how well a case will perform in day to day use . Installing the case is easy , anyone can do it . No need to discuss that , but I will say the main beef I had with the defender was the screen protector . I know some people pop it out and use invisibleshield or whatever else but to me the included screen protector 1 . is an important part of how well the case works and protects your phone and 2 . not worth it to me to pop it out on a case that 's over 30 . So you leave it in on the phone with no screen protector between the S3 and the defender screen protector . . . The problem is there is a small gap between the defender protector and the glass screen .I received my defender today and installed it over the screen protector I currently have which is the Spigen SGP ultra nano . Some things to note this is a top of the line screen protector and it does an amazing job of not gathering oil / grease . On top of that it is one of the thinnest screen protectors you can buy . So once I installed the defender on top of the spigen it worked absolutely perfect . I no longer feel the gap between the screen , the glass itself is protected from the potential dirt that can accumulate between the defender and the glass , and if I ever want to use a different case I still have the spigen on the screen .So for those of you like me who did n't want to pop out the defender screen protector even though there is small distortion , get the ultra nano spigen screen protector . I do n't think just any screen protector will work for this as I tried the cheap protectors from Verizon and it looked like a mess .Update After a week with this case I am still very happy . I really do n't drop my phone much or risk damaging it however I am OCD about scratches / scuffs on my phones . The screen protectors are still working very well . No loss of sensitivity . I occasionally do take the case off and use something else or no case and the defender is somewhat easy yet still very protective to get on and off . The outer silicon does n't show any signs of stretching yet however this happened to my Droid Razr defender case and Otterbox replaced it no questions asked .I highly recommend this case . The bulk added really is n't that bad . The only gripe myself and most people have is with the screen protector and it appears I have found the solution .	1

I ca n't believe people think this is good detergent . Maybe everyone buying it is a hippie who do n't know , or care to know , how to properly get clothing clean . This garbage leaves residue on the clothes making it feel . . . I do n't even know how to describe it , almost gooey or sticky . The powder often does n't dissolve well meaning you get clothes with powder particles on them when you take them out . I will never buy this stuff again . I 'm going back to ALL , folks . This detergent faded my clothes more in one wash than 50 washes of ALL . I ca n't bear to let things go to waste , so I will use to remainder of this crap on my whites . Oh , and it also destroys the lifetime of the fabric , expect holes and tearing shortly after you use this poison .	0

First mistake was purchasing a vehicle at Williamson Cadillac . First service call extremely disappointing . Only one in the service area , service writer walked by me 4 times without acknowledging me standing there . Finally I asked if he was going to help me or not ? Very bad attitude . I did n't buy a Cadillac , maybe that was the problem ? First warranty repair was a cable they claimed to have replaced . I decided to check before leaving , it was not replaced . I had repairs done at Williamson Collision , emailed , called many times to advisor and director for diagnosis and written estimate I paid for 101 . 65 . . . no response . Called Williamson GM Roger to finally get my estimate . The written estimate was 468 . 13 101 . 65Total 569 . 78 to replace a 28 . 80 part , 20 minutes labor . Replaced by another dealer . . . Obviously , I will never purchase another vehicle from Williamson Cadillac . .	0
Case was great until it was time for a warranty claim . Amazon wo n't do nothing about it because it 's past the first 30 days and UAG wo n't honor the warranty because they claim I bought a counterfeit . The case I bought stated it was sold and shipped by amazon .com which is what UAG says on their site is how to verify it 's an authentic one that they 'll honor the warranty on but guess what ? As soon as it 's time to actually honor that warranty they just claim counterfeit do they do n't have to .Nothing about my case leads me to think it 's counterfeit . It 's very sturdy , the faux screws look genuine and the serial number is there .I will never buy a UAG case again as they clearly do n't have any intentions of honoring warranties , even on authentic products .	0

Easy to install , very precisely cut , rounded edges , fits without bubbles . I have no way of knowing how if it meets the 9H hardness but it provides great protection for a great price .

The product itself seems to be a good product . My husband who suffers with severe osteoporosis likes the flavor and will actually take it AND let me know when he 's running low on a supply . I DO AGREE with the other reviewer though that the price for this product is ridiculous . I just shopped at a large , warehouse and paid 26 .99 for a pack of 16 . Given that , I think the greediness most likely is with the manufacturer of the product not the businesses that carry it . Its disgusting .Ensure Muscle Health Homemade Vanilla Liquid , 8Ounce Pack of 16	1

I really like the smaller size . It is just soft enough but also stiff enough to pop openThe size 2 , however , is WAY TOO STIFF . I wanted a bigger cup to hold more , but this one is sooo stiff . Probably the second most stiff , after the rubber keeper .Why does lunette make the size 2 much stiffer than the size 1 ? there is no reason to do that at all .stiff cups pop open easily , but they leak too because they do n't move with the body . So when you have been sitting for like one hour , it gets stuck in that position and does n't bounce back quick enough , so when you get up , it will leak . Same with running , dancing , sleeping , and all other activities .	0

I bought an Armour Tech matte screen protector for my new iPad mini and thought I 'd try it on my iPhone 5 too . Unfortunately , it does blur the clarity you have with retina display and it leaves whitish smudges instead of fingerprints .

1 . I 've got this cable , connected to my Acer Iconia A100 and tried to connect a USB keyboard , and then a mouse . Nothing happened at all .2 . As far as I did n't try to connect a USB drive , and neither a keyboard or a mouse needs the device to be rooted , I suspected that smth . is wrong with the cable itself .3 . So I attached a tried and working regular USB cable to this one and plugged it directly into my laptop . Once again , no reaction whatsoever . . .4 . Then I 've taken a direct MicroUSB to USB cable from my Kindle and connected it to Iconia on one end and the same USB port on the laptop on the other . The A100 was immediately recognized by the laptop , and I could see and access both the internal memory and the MicroSDHC flash card in My Computer .So I returned this one to Amazon . Of course , this only means that my particular cable is simply faulty . I am not sure about the others or the overall share of faulty cables , of course . . .	0
This is simply not a useful or cool product . The legs are far from easy to move or position , which defeats the whole purpose . The material just is n't right . Getting a balance of the individual legs on the surface , plus holding the iPhone , took more 5 minutes , and the legs do n't do a good job staying put not ' sticky ' enough . I do believe it would get easier with time and experience , but for what ? I would much rather a DIY solution binder clips or something you can find at the dollar store , as I did . Positioning this in the car vents is also a tricky proposition . Save your money , this is not a worthy investment .	0

I have the inflammation of plantar fasciitis and have found that this foot massager is able to sooth my muscles immensely enough so as to eliminate the pain altogether .The benefits for this device are plentiful , but it is also a great looking piece of furniture . In fact , this massager looks like a spaceship which would fit even the most modern decors .I have a shiatsu massager seat for the back , but find that one painful . This foot massager is never painful , but applies steady , firm pressure instead .There is only one thing that would make this item even better a remote control . The settings do not carry over from the previous time you use it , so you have to reset it each time by bending down . For those individuals for whom bending down might be difficult which is why they might not be able to manually massage their feet in the first place , it would be great to not have to bend down .	1

love the new 16 theatre complex in bellingham , wa . what would add a great deal to the pleasure of many people is a 2 or 3 movie that would be available all week , with a new film each week . the people who ca n't afford to go to see a movie and purchase snack bar treats could then do so , and since the theatre have a much higher profit margin on snacks , it would bring in more revenue for the theatre complex . kudos otherwise .	0

My wife posted a review months ago on here and the dealership replied saying they would reach out to her they did not . So I will repeat myself , Garlyn Shelton BMW is not military friendly , they do not respond to customers in a timely manner , and they are a bad dealership that I highly recommend you avoid . If you 're in the market for a BMW , make the drive to Austin . You will be treated much better , no one will lie to you , and you will know that they do not actively deceive Soldiers .	0
My wife and I bought this scale to replace our old one ! We were suspicious of our old scale not being accurate ! We were right , once we got this scale we were able to confirm our fears !

Very pleased with its performance , it was easy to set up right out of the box !	1

I was very happy with the quality of these locks . I got 5 for an up comming trip and had researched that now you have to have TSA approved locks or they will be cut off . I liked that I could set my own combinations .No they are not a dead bolt lock and I am sure they could be cut off but at least they give some piece of mind . I also am using one for my purse backpack . I read a book for Amazon that had travel tips that in airports and train stations , pick pockets are more than ever . I will have mine locked . They can cut the bag off me , but not just brush by and open it .Very happy with the quality and I could not pull it open by just fiddling with the combination .	1
Just recently placed this on my phone and it looks great . You may see scratches on the screen protector but when the phone is on it does not show . Plus it is easier to clean .

Above all , the adhesion quality of the screen protector is excellent thus far . I definitely recommend this item .	1

I have been going to Erhard BMW for a while now and Jim Cash is always amazing . He always does a great job every time I visit . If I were to give a rating , I would give him a 5 star rating instantly . This 1 star rating however is not for him . This is for my experience after I received the car after oil change was done . This is not the first time this has happened either . Previously it happened and I had to take the car back to them for a through clean up . I have a light color interior and gets dirty quick . When I received my car , there were black boot marks on the inside panel as you open front doors . There was also water inside the car all over the bottom carpet , a lot of water , both on the passenger side and the driver side . When inquired , I was told by another service rep present nearby that the guys powerwash the matts . I would assume for it to be common courtesy to power wash and then dry the matts off before throwing them back inside a customer / guest 's car . When I inquired if they powerwashed them inside the car because my car had a lot of water everywhere because of the wet matts and it was going to make things even dirtier , I was told no they are not that dumb . Well throwing dripping wet matts inside a car is not exactly very smart either especially because of beige interior and light color carpet . I am meticulous with my car . Inside and outside . I just did not have a very good experience because of this above incident . Left a very bad taste as I left the dealership . I had to spend an hour after reaching home cleaning up the inside .	0
I worked with Brad Kuller and Tyler Kalevitch to purchase a car . I had located a vehicle they had that I had negotiated online and was ready to come and purchase , but less than 24 hours from my agreed upon meeting time I was informed that the car was sold out from under me . I live in Los Angeles and was planning on taking a 2hour train to buy the car . These guys do n't care . They 're only interested in a sale . I 'm glad I do n't have to deal with them beyond this point . I 'm disappointed , but maybe it 's for they best if this is how they do business with a guaranteed 28k cash buy . Steer clear .	0

Updated ReviewI usually buy the low rise briefs but figured I 'd give these a try and they are so much better . They go perfect with low rise hipster jeans , and no wedgies ! The colors I got were great , too . The sizes on the package compared to jean size is not accurate though . I wear a size 16 jean and in underwear I am a size 6 . According to the package I should be wearing a 9 . . . .Well I bought these a few months ago and my opinion of these have totally changed . Within a week of washing and wearing , they started to tear at the seams and I 've already had to throw a pair of them away . Totally not worth what they cost !	0

After a few weeks of using Reach Total Care Floss , I can attest to the fact that it is a nice option if you are looking to keep your teeth clean ! Here are a few highlights of this product ! My old floss had a major flaw it would peel away and sometimes leave little bits of itself inbetween my teeth . I was really looking for this Total Care floss to not follow in my old brands footsteps . Thankfully , it did n't ! I am happy to report that I have yet to have a piece split open while flossing my teeth .It does n't slip away from my fingers when trying to get to hard to reach teeth . It has a bit of a stretchy quality to it that helps you really get a good hold on the string . Very handy for back teeth .It 's an interesting purple shade , which is pretty much an aesthetic thing , but might help you in getting kids to floss more . Me , I sure do n't mind having a bit of color on the sting . While the Listerine scent is strong before flossing , I ca n't say I 've ' tasted ' it at all . That being said , I typically floss after brushing my teeth , so my mouth still has a toothpaste like taste ! The strings are smooth and do actually pick up more floss than my old brand . I 've never felt them to be ' rough ' on my teeth or get stuck , for example .Overall , I really do n't see any negatives with this product . It does it 's job and it does it 's job well !	1

This ring is lovely ! It 's heavy and durable but very pretty too . Some of the reviewers said you can see where the band was soldered together . You can . A little bit . BUT it 's not severe and definitely does not detract from the beauty of the ring . I really have to look to find the area when I put the ring on . I would recommend this ring to anyone either male or female . It came on time and it 's really really heavy and does not bend at all . I recommend this ring to anyone that likes the weave design .	1
Similar to reviewer below , I received a warranty enhancement notice ie replacement but for a melting dashboard in 2014 / 2015 . Letter stated no action was required on my part at the time since they were working on readying the replacements . I have always gotten my 2004 vehicle serviced at Lexus of San Diego , and EVERY single time since receiving that letter I would inquire on the status of replacement to which the advisor John Little / or Christine Hoffman would respond they were not yet available . My most recent service advisor July 2017 indicated he called corporate on my behalf no previous advisor had indicated they did this and said I had missed the deadline May 31 , 2017 for the replacement . I called corporate to complain , they created a case and then told me I was denied as their records show I never asked Lexus of San Diego to inspect which is 1000 UNTRUE .	0
I bought this based on the reviews of cases for the Samsung Galaxy S3 . The phone fits very well and does n't add bulk to the already massive phone . However , sometimes when you press the volume key up , the volume goes down and vice versa .THIS IS VERY ANNOYING .UPDATE After removing the case a couple of times the sides of does seem to loose up .I also found out that the underside of the phone is slippery and I almost dropped my phone a couple of times . There were also a couple of stains near the cutout for the camera that I just noticed .	0

The MOACC case , previously known as the Rock Quicksand , is one of the best looking cases for the Galaxy S3 . It also has a 34rough velvet34 texture to it , making it smooth but with substantial grip . It does n't add any bulk to the phone .Before I got this case , I was using the Diztronic TPU case , but it left a lot to be desired . It provided good protection but it would get dirty quickly and you could pull back the case from the sides of the phone . Although this case leaves most of the top and bottom of the phone exposed , the unique grip reduces the chance of dropping it in the first place .If the case gets dirty , you can just wipe it with a lintfree cloth . It does n't pick up fingerprints the Diztronic did .Overall , I 'm happy with my purchase ! If you 're concerned about color , this case is n't totally black . It 's more like a dark grey , but it goes very well with the Pebble Blue Galaxy S3 .	1

Initial quality seems very good . Chrome plating is much better looking than on a Merkur . But it really is n't well constructed . It 's made of pot metal that rots from the inside out and can easily break . Lasts only a few years . Up to 10 if you 're lucky .Also the 3 piece design is a bit annoying to load . There are twist to open razors but they have a lot of fragile little mechanical parts that are exposed . In general double edge razors are not well designed . Both because of their loading mechanism , their paper thin blade that flexes / vibrates as it 's cutting leading to easy weepers , the blade sits at a 45 degree angle at the skin so it scrapes hairs off and not cuts . Because of this they can tug and blade life is much reduced so that even with two edges blade life is less than half of a single edge / injector razor which only uses one cutting side . Trust me I 've used a double edge for years before discovering better options . They are just inferior razors that are wrongly designed . Get a single edge , injector , or a straight razor .	0

This product works very well as intended as a way to recharge your iPhone when there is no available electricity . It will be very handy during power outages or when I do not have access to electricity and do not wish to leave my vehicle idling while I attempt to recharge my phone . However , it charges the phone much slower than electrical chargers . I timed the total recharge on my phone and it only charges about 20 of the speed that an electrical connection does . Therefore , I would not use it as a replacement for electricity , only in it 's absence .I have a few other rechargeable backup power supplies for our phones , but when they run out and there 's no electrify to recharge them , are useless . This product will still be useful in that situation even if the charge is slower . It will be very useful for long power outages . All I 'll have to do is replace the batteries as needed .The unit comes with two batteries and 2 charger cords . There is one lightning cord for iPhone 5 's , and there was also a charger that fits the iPhone 3 's and 4 's . That was an added bonus that I did not anticipate . In order to keep the batteries from completely depleting when not in use , remember to unplug the charger cord from the unit . If not , the cord will continue to draw power from the batteries until they 're depleted .	1
I bought this thing to hold my phone to the windshield when I need GPS directions . Also great for holding the phone up so that I can use the camera to take videos as I drive .

i would like a full refund for my gift cards since your site wo n't even let me use them . if i am denied this request as well then i may be forced to look into any and all legal rights i have concerning the funds which have been lost by the purchase of said cards . this is a great site to find movie times , but i have yet to see the benefit of online movie ticket sales , aside from fandango 's obvious collection of revenue in the form of extra convenience fees . i love going to the movies and my excitement has been replaced with heavy dissatisfaction . please convince me i am wrong .	0

Today , I received my new 34Waterproof Shockproof Dirtproof Snow Proof34 case . At opening the packaging , I was surprised how the quality was better than I thought it would . It is not Lifeproof R brand , but it is close enough for me .Pro 's Slim and Sleek Water Tight Seals Includes Headphone Adapter , Cleaning Cloth , and Removal Tool Extra Headphones Plug On Headphone Adapter Apple Icon is Seen on BackCon 's I would not treat this as a 34waterproof case34 that you want to purposely put in water . I feel it is enough to protect it if it is dropped in water and taken out right away , but not meant to be used for extended periods . My reasoning behind this is because of the loose seals .Helpful Tips Do not have a screen protect under this case . Rainbow colors will form from the littlest grease or residue . You have to have the mute / sound switch inside of the lever in the case . I had to bend mine a little to do this . Bottom not snapping shut ? You need to push a little harder for the complete click .I hope this review was helpful for any potential buyers . Wil .	1

Instead of simply wiping the screen off and aligning the screen protector while sticking it on , this product has many absurd steps that have consequences , even if followed correctly .First you 'll need to wash your hands and keep your fingers wet with the mini spray bottle that 's included . Then you 'll need to use the same liquid to spray both sides of the screen protector until both sides are soaked . Then you 're expected to place the soaking wet piece of plastic on your screen . Some of the liquid actually went inside the small hole that enables people to hear me when I 'm talking on my phone . I 'm not sure if any damage was done but that should n't happen .If the screen protector is n't wet enough , you 'll end up with bubbles that ca n't be removed . In that case , you 'll need to do the process all over again . It took me many tries to keep the screen protector wet enough and align it correctlybut in the end , one bubble still remainedand my fingers were n't wet enough so I ended up with a finger print too . It 's even more difficult to align than much cheaper products .This outrageous screen protector is still on my phone as I write this review but I 'm returning it as soon as possible . After all that trouble , I find out that this product is nothing special . It functions just as well as the much cheaper packages that include three screen protectors .In the end , this product it terrible and should be pulled from the market . Do n't waste your time and money .	0

UPDATEDONT GO HERE FOR SERVICE ! ! ! ! Just had new rear tire put on my Ducati 1098 . I do n't know if Honda and Kawasaki riders just do n't care or what , but my wheel has two big chucks taken out of it . Whoever was mounting the tire , clearly was n't paying attention . I did n't notice it right away , but after I rode it home about 4 or 5 miles , I was pissed . I 've had this bike since it was brand new in ' 07 and have had the rear tire changed numerous times without incident . Bottom line . . . do n't go here ! Go here for service , but stay away from the sales floor . Westside is great for completing the service work on my GS or Ducati , but their sales staff needs some work . My buddy showed up with cash in hand literally , ready to buy a Pannigale or S1000rr , but no one on the sales staff could be bothered . They would n't even loan him a helmet for a test ride ? Really ? What kind of dealership makes you use your own gear for a test ride ? He ended up getting a way better deal on 1299s from Ducati Redmond anyway , but what a horrible sales experience . The staff just could n't be bothered to make a sale . What a joke . As I said though , the service department is pretty good in my opinion .	0
I had high hopes for this when I saw how well my rather large smart phone stuck to the green adhesive portion of this holder . There are 4 points on this device if one of the 4 is sub par you have a worthless piece of junk . That is exactly what we have here . 3 out of the 4 parts are good . 1 is very bad . Here they are 1 . The suction mount . .Very good , it seems solid it was difficult to pull it off the windshield . Good long lasting material . 2 . The tightener for the adjustable arm . .also very good . When tightened down its not going to move . . 3 . The green sticky adhesive . .this is what I thought the weak point would be if there was one . Not the case . The adhesive is very strong , it holds a droid razr maxx with no problem . .Took some effort to pull it off . 4 . This is what makes it useless . the arm attaches to the phone holder using one of those ball in socket joints . .like garmin gps mounts . It just kind of flops around in its socket like the ball is too small for the socket . there is no way to tighten this up at all . So there is no way to position your phone or gps . It will stay where you want it for a second but if you were using this in a vehicle for example it would just droop straight down from basic driving vibrations . One option would be to super glue it so its stationary but not really what I wanted from an adjustable holder .	0

Updating for 10 / 2 / 17Took my car in on Tuesday , 8 / 29 / 17 for air bag replacement under recall . I dropped the car off , advisor said he should have the car back to me in a day . They were nt going to provide a loaner initially , but I asked for one anyways just in case it would take longer than a day . Advisor assured me it would be done by Friday at the latest . I never received a call again from Audi until Saturday , 9 / 30 / 17 . The call was nt even an update about the car Audi was calling to ask if I had one of their loaners . I asked what the status is of my car . They said they did nt know and would have my advisor call me back that day . On Monday , 10 / 2 / 17 , advisor calls me and says my car is ready to pick up , but they are unable to wash the car since the washer will be down for two months . I guess that makes six out of seven times that this service department drops the ball I have nt had my car serviced there since my last complaint / review . Had great luck at a service shop around the corner . Still amazed at just how poorly this team operates . 2015 The service department , just wow . Out of the last six times I 've had my car in there , five of the visits had problems . From incorrect pricing and ballparking final pricing to not being greeted for over thirty minutes to not having my car fixed they did n't notice the engine was misfiring to not getting responses to voicemails for over a week . You would think that for what they charge for maintenance , they could do a bit better than offering a free coffee and cookie .	0

when i used to sign in to my fandango account , i used to be able to find out bargain and matinee information at a glance on the right hand side where it has box office information . now there is box office information with a big red x . why can we not access this anymore ? sometimes my girlfriends and i just choose to go elsewhere than try to navigate and find prices to your different theatres and prices . can something be done ? does anyone care about retired or disabled people on budgets ? thank you . aandllaundry qwestoffice . net	0

These are simply wonderful ! I8217ve been taking this for only a few weeks now and the results are amazing ! I8217 m always extremely tired since I have chronic fatigue syndrome and I have tried countless products to help increase my energy coffee , energy drinks , energy shots , other energy supplements , etc . and nothing has helped me or they just gave me horrible side effects . So far , this has been the only product that has helped me get a dramatic daily energy boost ! And they are easy to swallow , no funny taste , and they do n't make you feel jittery , have an upset stomach , or none of those awful side effects like other energy products do . Also , I8217ve lost 7 pounds ! ! ! If you8217re looking for a daily energy boost or if you8217re wanting to lose weight , this is the supplement to get !	1
My dad who speaks broken English went into Fuccillo Kia of Greece to inquire about a lease . They played numbers around with him until he had to call me I was at work and could nt go with him , I spoke with Dan , and then his manager Pat over the phone both were using old salesman tricks on me . If I do this , am I going to get you as a customer ? That s not something I can do , I ve never tried that , Ill have to go ask my manager I m trying to help you out here You re only a tier two credit , but let me see if I can get you a tier one . They also flat out lie to me Pat says rolling over downpayments into the monthly payments of the lease is an unusual thing to do , and that I would be hardpressed to find a dealership that offers that anywhere in the country . Uh , those deals are all what Dick Ide offers ! He tells me the acquisition fees are nt included in the due at signing , when it says right there in the fine print that it does , but accuses of me of not reading the fine print myself when I was looking right at it . I kept telling them I understood cost and extras but I knew he was charging us too much . I thanked him for mansplaining things to me and told my dad to go to Toyota , because for the price they wanted him to pay , he could have gotten a camry . My dads English is limited , but he is also an oldschool sucker who wants to be liked and thinks salespeople are genuine and honest with him . He ended up getting the car an optima lx anyway , with a worse deal than what was promoted who gets a 12 , 000 miles / yr lease and pays 263 a month for that pleasure ? In comparison , my dad had just turned in his Honda Accord a much superior vehicle lease at 275 / mo with 15k miles / yr . If you hate games , or if you have a friend or family member who is easily duped , do not let them go to Kia Greece alone . And be cautious of the 5star reviews on here , a lot of dealerships offer incentives to buyers for them .	0

I wanted a pair of comfortable dressy shoes since I ca n't stand wearing high heels , and these are perfect . Very comfortable and still very cute . I read a previous review that said they are old ladyish but I disagree . They are real leather and I paid 30 , which seems like a great deal . I know prices on Amazon change quite a bit depending on the seller so I 'm not sure if they are still that cheap . They fit exactly as expected , came packaged well and on time .	1

I purchased this hoping that I could use it to charge my cell phone while driving . Today I plugged it into my power outlet and plugged my USB cell phone cord into it .

I was very disappointed in the Now Foods Amino Complete .First of all , I was under the impression that Amazon was required to disclose allergy information . These capsules contain powdered milk in the form of whey powder . People who are allergic to milk or are avoiding dairy should not buy this product . Also they are in gelatin capsules instead of the more common cellulose capsules .I used these 3 times a day for 2 weeks and did not feel any benefits . I even tried opening the capsules and mixing it with water and it does not dissolve . I imagine it does n't dissolve any better in your stomach .I ending up throwing away the rest of the bottle . This was a complete waste of money !	0
The service and maintenance department is awful . Every time I have taken one of our 2 Hyundais there we have waited 2448 hrs for someone to even look at our cars , and we have always had to call to get updates . When you do call you 're constantly being put on hold and transferred . Went in for an oil change , a week later the car breaks down on the side of the road , and has to be towed to the dealership . Was told that the car gave no indication it would break down when they changed the oil which I do n't believe . I was in a rental for 2 weeks , when we asked about them paying for a rental , and was told someone would get back to us , that never happened . When all was said and done , we 're out 5000 , and the whole time we were treated by the staff like we were inconveniencing them , the cashier even had the nerve to make a joke about how much our repairs were .	0
I 've been using this cable daily for nearly 10 months . I keep it plugged into a USB wall outlet next to my couch in the family room . It is great to have a cable that is long enough so that you can comfortably sit anywhere on the couch and use an iPhone / iPad while it is charging . I 've found it so convenient that I am buying another and am going to look for a similar extralong cable for the older 30pin connector for an older iPad unfortunately , Omni does n't seem to sell a 30pin connector cable .Other reviewers have complained that the cord is stiff and hard to coil . It is true that it is on the stiffer side , but that has n't mattered for my use case . It may not be the best cable for traveling or keeping in a small drawer . On the other hand it is quite durable and has stood up well to 10 month 's worth of daily use by multiple people in my family .	1

Bought a new 2500HD Duramax LTZ Z71 three weeks ago , returned it for the third time . Once for a check engine light on day 2 and then twice more because the transmission wo nt engage into Drive .

Pair this USB Wall Charger with an extra cord and you are good to go . For people on the go , it 's real handy to have at work as well as different places in your home . You 're not stuck with just one place to charge your electronic devices .	1

At the time that I wrote this review , I checked into the other reviews written . Half of them were written by people who only reviewed this company 's products , and had rated no other items . This leads me to suspect the reviewers had ties to the company . Now that I 've written this , I assume they will be more clever about faking their reviews . Buyer Beware .In any case , I paid a lot of money to try this product and am disappointed . Last night I used it on half of a pretty bad sunburn on my abdominal area / chest / arm and used Willard Water gel a product that costs less for a pint than this stuff costs for an ounce on the other half of my body in same areas . When I woke up in the morning , the side that had the polyactil treatment was more painful than the night before . The Willard Water Gel side is somewhat improved from how it felt last night but I am not entirely happy with the results of the gel , either .I was really hoping to try polyactil on a cyst / boil to see if it helps with those , but do n't have any now . For now I will give 1 star because it does n't appear to help healing of something as superficial as a sunburn and my faith in it is nearly depleted . If it works on boils , I 'll be raising my rating .If anyone out there has a cyst / boil / abscess that is n't remedied by this stuff , or you ca n't afford 20 for an ounce of something that might work but might not , try something that has proven ingredients and would cost a lot less in the long run . For abscess / cysts / boils / staph infections I make a mixture of1tbsp Emu oil100 Pure Emu Oil 4 fl oz 118 ml Liquid3 drops lavender oilLavender 100 Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil 10 ml3 drops tea tree oil3 drops calendula oil .All of these are available on Amazon .com or at health food stores . Be sure to test the essential oils for sensitivity before use by diluting 1 drop in 1 / 2 tsp olive / vegetable oil and applying to inner arm . If you have no reaction after 24 hours , it should be safe to proceed with the total of 9 drops in a tbsp of oil . Use the healing oil mixture on the affected area 35 times per day . Then apply twice daily for three days after pain has stopped or swelling is gone , whichever happens last . At night you can take some of the mixture and mix with baking soda to make a paste and smear this onto the boil / abscess . Never use baking soda on open wounds .For treating open , wet , or infected bed sores , I would not suggest using th epolyactil as was suggested on one website . I would instead suggest raw honey packed . If you google raw honey and bed sores you should find info on how best to do this .I wish good luck and great health to you all .UPDATE I used the product a second time on my abdomen / chest and broke out in about 100 whiteheads . It was most likely the salicylic acid that caused the reaction because this has happened to my face when I used an acne wash with this ingredient . Just use with caution , if you use it at all . For the price I really ca n't see why anyone would buy this , there are better products like Tiger Balm pretty good and Traumeel my favoriteHeel Traumeel Ointment 50 g .	0

For the quality of the produce and enjoyment I received , words can not describe what a good purchase this was ! I have never purchase an adult toy sight unseen before as I believe it is hard to judge the quality of material without seeing it in person . If I 'm going to be putting something in an intimate area it has to be something I am comfortable with . Given that this particular dildo was under 20 dollars , I was a little leery but figure I could give it a try knowing that I just seen a similar one priced at 39 .99 at an adult toy store .I was not impressed with the packaging and there was a define rubbery smell to the item . I was regretting my purchase until I took it out of the bag . I was immediately intrigued by the feel of the dildo . It was firm in all the right places yet soft and pliable most realistic dildo I had ever touched . I scrubbed in down and the smell was gone . I went from disappointed to excited ! I purchased it with the intent that it would be my new shower time buddy , but it was so heavy I did not think that the suction cup would be enough to hold it to my shower wall . But I was so , so wrong ! I have never been so pleased with be so wrong ! Move over rubber ducky ! Sexflesh has just become a woman 's goto bath buddy !	1

My friend told me he 'd tried this product , and I figured I 'd give it a try to help me with my weight loss goals . I like that it 's based on a natural ingredient green coffee beans and is made in the US . I 'm someone who does n't like taking many pills , so this product 's regiment is something I 'm happy with . Only have to take it twice a day , 30 min before a meal . I 've been happy with my results so far . I have n't had any side effects whatsoever . Overall , weighing the product cost vs what I have experienced this product has great value . Recommended .	1

This product had some hidden shipping fees that made ot really not worth the money .

The case came in two pieces , and did not fit together properly the seam where the red clear pieces go together did not match , anddid not provide a sealed barrier . . The case did not fit properly .

First off , I only got to try this product for one massage cycle , as that is how long it worked . Did not do anything for me though . The massager is pretty weak , and by weak I mean you can barely feel it . There are 10 levels that you can easily skip through , but I do not see the point of the first 9 , since level 10 is still not enough to actually make you feel anything . If you need pain relief , this is not it . Where I live we have mosquitoes , and they seem like Hulk compared to this thing .After my first cycle , one side stopped working , so this product is returned to Amazon and I will not purchase again . I will barely consider this product if I get one offered for free , and even if someone did offer it to me for free , I would probably look elsewhere for something that actually works .	0
I bought these shorts for my wife who rides her mountain bike to school . The trip is 30 minutes each day . After ONE day , the area where the shorts rub the seat is rubbed through and ripping . And even before she put them on , we could see they were made very cheaply the padding was put in misaligned and the shorts were n't very comfortable but note that this problem with the padding is completely separate from the material ripping . One star , wasted money too bad . I wish I could exchange them .	0

I use 60 drops in the washing machine during the last cycle of a large load , instead of using chemicalladen fabric softener . The clothes come out with a refreshing peppermint smell that fades into a simple , pleasant fragrance by the time the clothes are done in the dryer .I've also tried using closer to 100 drops of this oil on our bath towels , which make them smell really nice when coming out of the shower / tub . Give your body a break from the constant contact with chemical detergents and softeners , and give essential oils a try .Tip If you decide to use essential oils instead of fabric softener , and you dry clothes with a dryer , you may experience static cling . Simply toss a few balls of crumpled up aluminum foil into the dryer to greatly reduce any cling	1
Nice car , bad customer service . We had Ricky . He was a nice guy but had no idea how to close a sale . We wanted to pay for the car mostly in cash and finance about a quarter of the cost about 2k . He hit us with our banks say you have to finance at least 7500 . He then disappeared into the finance office to haggle the price and we did n't see him for 30 straight minutes . We were n't offered a drink once in the 2 hours we were there . No communication for a half an hour is not acceptable . When we stood up to walk out , I poked my head in the finance office and said we were leaving for said reasons and were met with well we got you the deal , sorry it 's the bank 's fault . FYI they did n't get us the deal . Not impressed and wo n't be returning .	0

I have leased 3 cars at this dealership , and this one leased on 3 . 28 will be my last . The treatment that I have received in the last 3 months since starting my new lease has been unacceptable . I was billed for excessive wear and tear , I should have been made aware of this , however , the dealership submitted a signed / dated form without my knowledge / consent . After being assured a check request was made on 6 / 5 to cover this cost , I have yet to have the credit made to my account . This not only reflects poorly on the dealership itself , its ruining the BMW brand .	0

Lexus , please reconsider your customer service . When I purchased the car , they did the paperwork for the wrong car . When I came to resign , they forgot to transfer the tag and I was pulled over twice in 24 hours countless times that month . Now , I have a light flashing that I have required maintenance at 4 , 000 miles with a GPS continuously asking me if I want to go to the dealership . I find out that it only wants its tires rotated , which normally happens at 10 , 000 miles . This is crazy ! I take my one day off to find out you want 15 , 000 cash to get out of this lease and the car has depreciated 5 , 000 per month . A BBB complaint has been filed .	0
As an A cup , nothing would thrill me more than to naturally grow a size bigger .

I bought these tights for my sixyearold . They were expensive especially compared to the 6pack of navy ones I bought , which were made by a different company , but I figured they would probably last longer so they 'd be worth it . WRONG !

I 've had the NT70 T for a little over a week now and I 've been very pleased with it . So far I 've used it with an iPhone 5 , iPhone 4s , and LG Optimus 3D . The LG phone worked great with the built in micro usb charger , and the iPhones worked flawlessly with the dual usb ports . In the past I 've had external batteries with usb ports that were difficult to use because it was hard to plug in my cords and remove them , so I was very pleased the NT70 T ports were just as easy as using the wall plug my phone came with .The battery could easily charge two iPhones at once , and I loved the LED lights that would display how much power was left in the battery itself . The only thing is , while phones are charging you have to push the power button to show the LEDs . The only time the LEDs are constantly on is when the battery pack itself is charging and they show you how far along in the charge the battery is which I found to be quite helpful .Now this battery does take a long time to charge itself , so be prepared to just charge it overnight before you plan on taking a trip and using it , but that is to be expected with such a high capacity battery . Also , know that the battery itself does not come with a wall outlet plug , but it can be plugged into the same plug you use for your smartphone or other device with a usb charger .The one thing I really wish this device had was a built in iPhone charger , and I hope that New Trent will make such a product in the future , but thankfully this device works flawlessly with my iPhone regardless .I was able to fully charge my iPhone 5 four times after only charging this battery pack once . My phone battery was at anywhere from 920 and I charged it to 100 each time . Each time I also used my phone while it was charging , so I imagine you could get even more charges if you did n't use your device during charging .I would highly recommend this battery pack . It looks great , holds a lot of charge , and is small enough to take nearly anyplace you would go .	1

Holy Basil is an adaptogen and has been used to support a healthy response to stress , maintain blood sugar levels within a normal range , promote longevity , nourish the mind and elevate the spirit .I went through 10 years of serious insomnia . I could lay awake all night without sleep , or would perhaps finally drift off a couple of hours before time to get up . It was sort of that feeling where your brain wo n't shut off . I never suffered from any depression or anxiety during my waking hours but there was a definite sense that a circus was taking place inside my mind once I crawled into bed . You would think that after a night or two of little or no sleep that exhaustion would finally force sleep upon me by the successive nights . . .but no luck . If anything , after multiple nights of severe insomnia , the possibility of sleep became even less . My doctor tried me on a couple of sleep medications and over the course of about 10 years I took Ambien every night in order to sleep . I felt great while on it but worried that it was not a good choice to have to depend upon for the rest of my life . Three years ago , I started working to wean myself off the Ambien and tried a bunch of different natural supplements in hopes that something would work herbal blends , melatonin under my tongue , relaxation techniques , you name it . During this time , I also changed doctors . My new doc tends to focus on alternative healthcare , but not at the exclusion of traditional medicine . He suggested that I take Holy Basil 3045 minutes before bedtime along with my calcium / magnesium supplement . After 10 years of majorly struggling with this issue , it now seems so simple and a bit weird that this is all that it takes for me to get a good night 's sleep . But I do get wonderful , wonderful sleep now . It offers a safe means of calming my mind so that I can fall asleep and stay asleep . I may occasionally get lax about ordering and taking some of my other supplements but I make sure that I never run out of my Holy Basil . I had been buying this from a local health store for a considerably higher price and was delighted to see the savings that I can usually get from buying it on Amazon .The bottle recommendation says to take two capsules per day but for my sleep needs , I 've only been taking one at nighttime . For those people needing help with stress during daytime hours , it would probably be best to take the recommended dosage .	1

This is kind of an off brand of antacid , but I purchased it based on the positive reviews . There is something that is generally sort of nauseating ironically about antacids . Part of it is the texture and part is the flavor . This brand has good results in both departments . The flavors do n't seem overpowering , and the texture is consistent i .e . no larger chunks of harder material hidden inside . I would definitely switch to this brand exclusively . I wo n't review the 34effectiveness34 of this , because when it comes down to it , it 's all calcium carbonate , and does the same thing . But , a spoonful of sugar . . . .	1

I post this in hopes of deterring anyone from wasting their time or money from buying a car from this place . I will say upfront the service department has been nothing but great and courteous . I purchased a precertified 328i two years ago and it had turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life . The car is a total lemon and the sales staff has done nothing to address or correct the problem . I have attempted to contact the sales department on a number of occasions to discuss the ongoing issues . To no avail , I have never gotten a return call and am constantly dodged . Be extremely weary of dealing with this group . They do not stand behind their product and have zero customer service . Do n't let the term precertified fool you , it does n't mean a thing when the car starts to fall apart . Again , if you are looking to get your car fixed and believe me I 've been in plenty of times , you ca n't go wrong with the service department .	0

my only complaint about the GS4 was that the camera did n't have wide enough angle view to take pictures of interior spaces . this little 10 lense solves the problem . it fits over my spigen case w / no problem .

I wanted a black leather bag larger than the one I currently own because of all the stuff I need to carry when out and about . I ordered the small after reading the reviews between the different sizes . I was surprised when I opened the package and saw how big the 34small34 was . Still , I am glad I did n't order the extra small and am really glad I did n't order the medium .The inside has plenty of pockets and a zippered area to keep my inhaler / space , other meds , dry mouth spray , wallet , hand cream , and other small stuff . I still have plenty of room inside to carry my iPod , iPhone , Kindle Fire HDX and Kindle Paperlight in a combined neoprene case . If I wanted to , I can also stuff a sweater and water bottle inside .Took it for an all day shopping trip test run without the water bottle and sweater . The weight never felt heavy with it slung over one shoulder . I almost canceled this order and am very glad it was too late and already shipped .	1

It was love at first sight the color , the trim , the first tryon ! I was so happy , I was ready to order 3 more pairs . However , between the time I put them on and the time I arrived at work , they had turned into baggy , saggy mom jeans . I was so embarrassed and would have gone home to change if I could have , but I had to spend the day wearing and hating these jeans . Even putting on my long office sweater did n't hide the mess . I wrote to Lee about this via their web site , but never got a response . Oh well , they wo n't get any further business from me .Update 4 / 29 / 13 . Lee finally responded asking me to return the jeans to them so they could determine if there was a product failure . Uh , yes , there certainly was ! 7 weeks after I returned them , VF Jeanswear sent me a letter stating that they were unable to replace my jeans and that with the enclosed check they hoped I would continue to buy their products . The check was made out to another name . Sorry , but I ca n't change my 1 star rating .Update 5 / 30 / 13 It took 4 inquiries to Lee to get the refund check issue resolved . It 's apparent that they have customer service issues which , of course , have nothing to do with the quality of the product . But bad service bad product no future purchases .	0

Soft , Septic Safe and Made in USA this TP gets the job done . The Charmin Basic Toilet Paper 10 Packs Of 4 Double Rolls is actually 10 packs of single roles . Regardless , for less than a dollar a roll , this is a good deal .You'll save even more if you purchase via the AMAZON Subscribe and Save program . Highly recommend . Let 's face it , it 's toilet paper and unscented . Worth the price when compared to the other brands .	1

I recently bought my new car from Tom Bush Volkswagen and had a great car buying experience , thanks to Brett Sanders . This was my very first time buying a car and he was knowledgeable about the different payment options and helped me figure out which option to go with to get me into my dream car .

They just do n't make these brush heads like they used to ! The bristle piece slowly loosens from the shaft over time , and becomes extremely loose long long before the bristles wear out . This has happened on 2 out of 2 of the brush heads I 've used so far , and I wo n't be surprised if they other 2 do the same . UPDATE all of them are busted now . . .I bought these to replace one that I had for a very long time years but was actually still in good shape , not loose at all and the bristles on these things really last ! . Anyway , these are namebrand , so I do n't know what I 'll do for an alternative . . . but I 'm definitely disappointed .	0

Went with my boy friend . Have nt seen a sloppy sales and service like this ever in my life . I was too shocked at the level of service for a luxury segment car especially now is the era of the smallest of brands matching the technologies the only differentiator one can look for is service and trust . This particular dealership is a nightmare be it for buying or service . The sales rep apparently does nt get paid commissions so he does nt care to sell is what I am told by him .	0
I recently purchased a preowned BMW from Audi of W Palm Beach . The salesperson Danyela Olivares was very attentive and professional , she went out of her way to make my purchase very stress free , even to the point of delivering my car to my home . The manager , Shawn Haidari , also went above and beyond with the purchase and had services performed on the car as I had requested , he was honest and did what he said , a rare quality in today 's world . I would highly recommend this dealership and the people that represent it .	1
Julie Sanders was the best ! She was so helpful and kind . She helped me walk through the process of buying my first BMW . Could n't ask for a better experience when buying a car ! ! THANK YOU !	1
Too many issues make this a Bluetooth Headset to avoid .First and to me most important , the sound is horrible . Very tinny sounding which makes it hard to understand anyone especially if there is an accent involved . If it 's not functional in this manner what is the point in using it ? Second , Its cheap plastic that has beem manuafacturered in a way that does n't really fit the ear well . I 've used head sets from a number of manufacturers and although very few are a perfect fit , most are workable . Not this one .Third , it 's over priced . Maybe at 50 or less . Maybe . But not at an 80 price tag . Just not worth it .Personal opinion , pass on this one .	0
While I have only had these Asics for one day I can tell you that they fit as advertised and seem to be on par quality wise with other asics I have owned . I go to the gym 6 days a week and do cardio and weight training on all of those days . I found these sneakers to be comfortable and durable . I see no reason why I will not get 6 months to a year of wear out of them . In my opinion they are a steal for the price .	1

Kuni . Buyer beware ! ! ! Willie Higgins the certified pre owned sales manager actually told a stranded mother of 3 stranded due the car kuni recently sold her going dead on a dangerous highway with her child that he wo n't help . Kuni made her source and pay for her own tow truck . And Willie wo n't take the car back . And he wo n't make her whole . He 's not going to give her any special treatment . Or even humane treatment . Once you buy that certified pre owned car from Kuni . . even if it 's dead the next day . . . they will tell you too bad you own it now . Shame on you Kuni !

I 'm not sure if Preowned BMW of San Diego is a part of you , but I had the worst salesman experience ever from Daniel . Now being a prior salesman , I know that you have to make a buck and weed out the people you think you wo n't make a sale with , but as soon as I entered and asked for a salesman he came out to greet me , and when I told him I was looking at an M4 he questioned when I was looking to buy and when I gave him the answer within the next week or two . He immediately blew me off and basically said that if I have any questions I most likely already know the answer and he walked away . Terrible , we did n't even walk to check out the car . Will not be buying from them when it 's time to purchase .	0

Ordered several bmw carbonfiber parts from them for my M4 . The first I came in to install the parts , they told me they did not purchase the glue to install the parts after I left the car there for THREE hours , and they said I needed to pay for the glue . The second time I came to install after I PAID for the glue , they installed the spoiler unsymmetically as the pic shows . While I talked with them , they said the only option I have they said it was the only option is to buy a new spoiler and reinstall . I argued it was not my responsibility and the agent became really impatient and impolite . Finally he said there was nothing they could do today , and I need to make an appointment again to fix it . Let 's see how this gon na end .	0

Went in to replace the passenger window which had been broken by a thief . My insurance offered to pay 650 for the replacement but the BMW dealer wanted 3x that amount . I requested my vehicle back because the dealership could not reach an agreement with my insurance company . When my car arrived I noticed that the plastic which they had placed over the window was leaking . The fact that it was raining made matters worse . When I expressed my dissatisfaction with the service the dealership agreed to take the vehicle and replace the wrap . 20 minutes later I received my 550 back with a new piece of plastic over the window and a warning light saying that the seat belt system was not functioning properly . This light was not on in the vehicle before I brought it in to them and was also not on when I had initially gotten my car back . Really upset with the service I received . I eventually called Safe Lite who repaired the window and cleaned the car for under 350 .	0

I copied a comment from Nokia chat room . I researched because I 'm having the same problem with my Nokia 1020 . Very annoying and disappointed ! According to the specs , the Lumia 1020 should be able to autofocus as close as 15 centimeters , not 15 inches . That said , I 'm seeing the same problem as noted in this post . Typically , if my subject is between 15 cm and 25 cm away and I hold down the shutter halfway to focus , or touch the screen on a focus point , the focusing system temporarily focuses , but then immediately pops back out of focus .SOMETIMES I can focus up to 15 cm , but it 's not consistent and so I 've been finding it difficult to get macro shots in general with the phone . I realize that the zoom in capability of the pro image minimizes this problem , but I just keep running into it . Now I know others are too . Either there is a batch of defective phones and we both got one , OR this is normal behavior for all of them .Edit 10 / 23 / 13 Well I 've had this phone now for about 3 weeks and discovered that the battery starts to get really hot when I was speaking on it for over an hour and after hanging up it still continue to drain . Even when left without using it drained 80 of the battery to 10 in just 6 hours . It was n't doing this before until last night . I charged it again and conducting more tests at this time on the battery issue . As far as camera close up shots , yes it does n't work anything less than 6 inches , I did n't say as minimal as 1 / 6th . You wanted to know the truth and I 'm telling you the truth . I did n't buy another 1020 from some of your responses . I exchanged it .	0

I 've had nothing but positive experiences every time I 've brought my Lexus in for service . Rob P . , the service manager , makes servicing my Lexus easy and fast .

I 've owned 4 Lexus 's , and with service like Rob 's , I am sure I will be getting a 5th .	1
I was treated badly by the entire staff the whole process . From the buying to the service , they are the most arrogant and cocky dealership I have ever dealt with . I purchased a tire and wheel protection package for my sons car because I had issues with my older sons cars and curb rash , I was assured by the salesman Joe Spidero that it was covered . When I brought it in to get fixed they told me it was n't covered for cosmetic and I should have read the pamphlet more closely . I guess I should have assumed the salesman was a liar ! When I asked to speak to the manager he got on the phone and basically told me oh well , that 's what you signed . I paid cash in the amount of 45 , 000 for this car and that 's the way I was treated . When I went to pick the car up the windshield was cracked in half , they said are you sure it was n't like that when you dropped it off . Fortunately they did pay for that , nice of them considering they are the ones who broke it . I would n't recommend this dealer to anyone . Stay away ! Once they get the sale they just do n't care about you anymore .	0

I took my car in for service . I dropped it off and the next day when I went to pick the car up , the front bumper had damage . I let Khalil Chaaban , who was extremely rude with me . He check the diagram that was noted when I dropped the car off and saw that the car was not checked in with the same damage . He offered to fix the car only if I leave the car for 5 days . I told them I have my own body shop and they will fix it in a day . He told me to give them a quote and they will write me a check . When I gave him a quote , Khalil Chaaban became extremely rude and condescending . He forwarded the complaint to his manager Frank Gonzalez who was even ruder , and argumentative . He kept referring to me as buddy in a condescending way and telling me that 's the only offer on the table , buddy instead of being apologetic and courteous about damaging my newly painted car . Finally when I got my insurance involved , which gave me a quote about 200 dollars higher that my original body shop did , Frank Gonzalez and Khalil Chabaan lied to the insurance company . Saying that they offered to fix the car as a courtesy and that the car was damaged before I had even gotten there , which was an out right lie , or else they would not have offered to fix it or write me a check for the damages . My experience at Kia Of Downtown LA has been awful , horrible , almost a nightmare . So I am writing this complaint now to tell you I was cheated by Frank Gonzalez and Khalil Chaaban , . I want to let the people of KIa know how their Kia dealership in on of the prime locations of Los Angeles is being run by a group of guys who lied to me and cheated me after damaging my car . As a business owner myself , I recognize People like Khalil Chabaan and Frank Gonzalez should not be in the customer service business representing a huge brand like Kia . I have forwarded a copy of this complaint along with pictures to the executives of Kia of which their emails I found online . Maybe all of them will not receive the email , but I am sure more than one person will get the email and take notice of how badly customers are being treated This is not Franks first complaint on yelp . I really tried to work with these guys before having to resort to this . I spoke to Khalil to try one last time to resolve this and he ended the conversation by saying Do whatever you want to do , I ca n't help you . The list below is the people I have forwarded this complaint too . James Bell Director of Coroprate communications for KIAJames Hope National Manager , Product Communications for KIAHoward Lim Sr .

Biokleen has changed their formula . They now use Sodium Lauryl Sulfate the very reason I had used their product was that it did not have this chemical which means if you 're allergic , you will most likely react and buy a product that you ca n't use .

One of the worst experiences that I had with an automotive repair facility . I will not recommend Harold Ziegler auto group on stadium drive . I called on Saturday the 12th and spoke to Bill about the problem with my 2001 Ford excursion 7 . 3l diesel and he said to bring it over and drop it off . I fully explained the symptoms and problems that I was having with the vehicle and he excepted the vehicle and said that it would probably be Monday till they have a chance to look at it I left it over the weekend . I explained to Bill that it would not start call unless it was plugged in for about an hour to an hour and a half before trying to start . Then Monday came around and I got a phone call from George stating that they could not do anything as they do not have a diesel technician . I asked what should I do or where I can take it and he suggested that I take it to Harold Zigler in Plainwell . So instead of wasting more time I called out there and ask if they could properly diagnose the vehicle as they could not here in Kalamazoo I was told by them that they do not have a diesel technician out there . It is really nice they Harold Zigler automotive group can not service vehicles that they sell . This is very upsetting from a Ford motor company establishment . I was quoted an hour diagnoses 105 and was willing to pay that but they are any unable to service my vehicle and gave no solutions . They acted like it was not their problem . On Wednesday , August 16 I had time to run over there to pick up my vehicle and I called ahead of time to be sure that the vehicle had been plugged in for at least an hour to an hour and a half so that I can start the vehicle and drive it away . I called ahead to make sure of this but no one would even run out to check . I show up it looked and appeared to be plugged in but it was unplugged from the truck . I spoke to an auto technician out back which I am unsure of his name he grabbed a jump pack and at least let me use that to try and jump it but by the time I crank it over and over until it had run dead . I have been here for several hours trying to get this accomplished And runningPlease everyone be aware of the poor service that I have received here . And choose wisely on where you want to take your vehicleI will be very surprised if I get a call or email from this establishment to speak to someone about what has went on . I feel that there is some accountability that has to be takenThanks for listening	0
Easy , simple set up , one to your Aux , one to cigralet lighter , done . One touch to connect or turn on your phone after start engine then it connect automaticly , not pairing show orange color , once pair , show blue color , incoming call , light was brinking orange blue , just press once connect , end the call , press once or leave it hand up call are really clear , stream music for iphone really good bass , but not for android phone or tablet nexus 7 , all the bass are cut off no bass recommend item	1
made order and it was sent after about 8 days I inquired about status of item . I was sent a email stating order was canceled . Still do nt know why .	0
I do n't know if I just got a bad set , but all 3 were way off on the cutting . To line up the ear hole , it causes the button hole to be misaligned and on top of that the whole thing was too large . it caused bubbles around the whole rim because it would not fit inside of the rim which is slightly higher than the screen . Horrible QC to say the least .	0
My overall impression with these car GPS mounts is rather pessimistic . I have tried replacements for Garmin , TomTom and SmartPhones . In all cases , I8217ve got weak , crappy and low quality mounts or bulky , impractical and low quality ones .I8217 m glad to report that this particular mount is a nice exception . I have been using it for about 2 months , through the summer and it is holding nice and tight . Here some details Great iPhone Grip It holds iPhone 4 / 5 without any problems , on the road and on the dirt . My previous experience with other holders is that some bumps in the road will cause the iPhone to go down . This one holds nice . No shake The structure of the holder is stiff and solid . It stays put . Suction Cup Nice design , it sticks to the windshield very nice . I have changed it few times from one vehicle to another and is still holding strong . Size It is not bulky and it is not small . I think the designed balanced the structure very accurately . Assembling Really a no brainer . One snap and one click and it is on . Cost at 16 bucks I think is money well spent . I you happen to planning on buying this and you have a cheaper hold in mind , please think carefully and read reviews . You may want to check my reviews , don8217 t buy the cheap holder I reviewed , that was money out the window and lots of frustration .	1
I loved these shoes . . so cute alil snug but overall comfy ! The heel is not too high for me either which is good because I am flat footed so these were just perfect ! Will keep for sure !	1
The only down side is that mine arrived solid black , not twotone like the picture . But , that 's the risk you take when you buy a product hand made of natural material sight unseen , so I wo n't hold it against them . I 'd have used a picture of my nicest bowl too were I in their place lol . At any rate , solid black does n't look bad and it serves it 's intended purpose . I 'm happy with it .	1
I read other accounts of Jarrow B12 , 5000 mcg . It kept coming up as the most effective for several people . I 've taken other brands with good results but this WAS noticeably more effective . After using it for only about 1 week , I wholly agree energized , alert , and clearheaded ! I do take a few other cognitive enhancing products Phosphatidyl Serine , Phosphatidyl Choline , DMAE , ALA , DHA in Fish Oil , but this STILL had an impact ! DO NOT take late in the day !	1
The charm is actually a little bit bigger than it looks in the picture . The chain is long , boob level or lower , depending on your height . Nice details . This is the perfect gift for photography nuts .	1
Bought a 2008 Sewell RX350 in 2010 thought I was buying a luxury SUV , not so . First problem melting rubber handle on back door . Went to a Houston Lexus dealership and was told 500 to fix , could n't just replace rubber cover , had to replace whole unit . Second problem chrome finish on both rear wheels is peeling another defect . Third problem had to replace water pump 1000 bill . All this on a ' 08 garaged RX 350 with less than 80k mileage ! Had less problems with my 2000 Ford Explorer and 2004 Nissan Pathfinder . No problems with either one last Lexus for me !	0

I had taken my car in for service at Mercedes Benz of Clear Lake For a tire replacement . Alejandro was my service consultant and he was very friendly and knowledgeable . He had ordered my tire earlier that morning so that it would arrive in the afternoon . I mentioned about 2 recalls on my vehicle and immediately he knew about the recalls I was referring to without having to explain . While I waited , he came to the waiting area to check up on me and explained how far along the service process was and gave me an estimated finish time . His customer service skill was impeccably ! I was extremely impressed with Alejandro .	1
This review is just for these flosser headsI've never purchased them from Amazon , but based on other reviews , if they are purchase from Amazon through another seller , there is a high risk of them being counterfeit . Who knew ? My husband and I have been using these brush heads for a couple of years now , and could n't be happier . Our dentist noticed a change in six month 's time when we switched to the Oral B electric toothbrush . Another dentist said I wish all people took as good of care of their mouths as you do ! and barely had to do any teeth cleaningand that is when I was only flossing once a month or so . In addition to bristles , there are four thin rubber pads on the brush . I would think this helps with polishing the teeth , too . Nothing replaces daily flossing , but these brush heads do provided a deeper and more satisfying clean than other brush heads we 've tried .These are definitely more expensive than generic nonelectric toothbrushes , but for the money they will save us on dental work in the long run , they are well worth it . Electric toothbrushes really do provide a better and more efficient clean . Also , do n't waste your money on generic replacement heads . I 've tried a few different brands , and the bristles started falling out after a few uses . These brush heads are the way to go !	1

i usually would nt say anything about something like this but this situation bothered me we were at freehold nj metroplex and when the movie this is 40 was about to start the bulbs blew it took then 20 minutes to finally tell us it was nt going to show then had to wait on a hige line to be told our refund would be given to see another movie . this is after we spent 40 on candy , soda and popcorn . when we did go back a few days later to see the movie i asked since i paid 10 . 50 and i am seeing a matinee would i be refunded the diff in a voucher for food . the guy was so rude looking at me as if i were asking for a million dollars . sometimes management needs to be reminded that a question is nt always a stupid one ! made me feel like i was an idiot . just thought i would address this	0

These adapters did n't last more than a few days of daily use before breaking . Ironically they all failed just above the strain relief on the male plug .When these fail you 'll see exposed wires or the male end will break off which in a way is a nice change from other adapters that fail internally and still look OK from the outside .	0
Rude and uncaring staff , the deadest dealershipI've never seen a Mercedes dealership so empty , I 've bought cars at Mercedes dealerships in Knoxville and Atlanta and they 're always full of customers buying vehicles . I do n't know how Rick Hill stays in business , the salespeople look bored and uninterested in making a sale . They look miserable . Everyone I know shops out of town because the customer service is so bad . I just wonder if Rick Hill is even involved with his business , if he only knew how much money and business he loses from his own community buying cars out of town instead . FYI , when you go in and see how dead the dealership is , there 's a reason for that .	0

I have been applying screen protectors to devices since the original Palm Pilot came out . I 've even applied screen protectors using the identical three layer process . I have never had a problem . Yet I just spent an HOUR trying to successfully get one of these useless things on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 . I 'm on protector number two and will have to try my third and last , but I 'm thinking I 'm out 10 bucks and my time and I 'm feeling frustrated and even angry .The protector is so thick and rigid that when I try to smooth the 1 backing down as I ATTEMPT to install the protector , the whole protector lifts off the phone the backing is n't tacky enough to resist its desire to straighten , ruining the carefully placed alignment . I finally removed more than two inches of that backing so there 's enough to actually stick to the phone . I thought I actually got it but there were HUGE air pockets around the edges of the phone . In error , I thought I could buff them out , but it 's impossible and no , they 're not from dust . And NOW , there 's no protective backing so the entire screen protector needs to be lifted and resmoothed with the whole thing exposed to air and potential dust . I suspect this is design related with the protector being a bit too wide . The slightly raised lip of the Galaxy Note 3 makes it impossible to get the protector flush against the sides of the device , so it lifts air pockets . You can try to smooth out the huge air gaps but they return again and again because you ca n't get the protector 100 flush against the phone .The first protector somehow got a hairline crease in it , so I had to try a second protector and experienced the same air pockets . Now , dust has inevitably comes into play from my many frustrated attempts to fit this stupid thing dust removal stickers are a sick joke they do NOT remove dust from the protector 's tacky side at all , so I 'm going to have try the third and I ALWAYS get protectors installed first try . I 've never needed to go to a second , never mind a third .Unless you enjoy futility , frustration and wasting money , AVOID .	0
I had an appointment at noon for my 70 , 000miles service and had requested a loaner car . I waited 45min and still did n't get my loaner car . I have another appointment to go to so I told her I would take my car back if there 's no loaner . She came back saying my car was all done . A service that she at first said was going to take at least 2 hours . If they would 've told me they did n't have a loaner car in the first place I would 've just make an appointment for another day . Will never be back .	0

I bought this along with an additional battery . My original and the additional batteries look exactly the same as the battery which came with this charger almost . This one is blue , and is missing a few lines in Chinese , but is otherwise identical .Until you try to use them .Neither black battery would charge in this charger , and though the blue battery did charge in the charger , when I put it in my Samsung Galaxy S phone , though it ran , the battery icon flashed red , and when it ran out of charge even though it was plugged in I got the error message that the phone was n't programmed for this battery type .Beware .	0
I love it and hate it at the same time ! Love the convenience and the style . Hate that if I lose it , I lose a lot . There is no real way to fit cash in to this case .

I already had a money clip lying around and I kind of like reaching in my pocket and feeling my cash .I was concerned about quality because this is much less expensive than bookbook .

Big let down . The staff let 4k cash money walk out the door because they wanted to charge 1900 bucks for a 800 dollar kids go kart , one that had been sitting for 2 years and had some of the seat chewed off by a racoon . While there I was looking and decided on buying a kawi 125 if they would have made a cash price package deal . Instead they wanted to insult my fiance 's intelligence and wanted us to pay double the online price of a 2 year old kids go kart . Needless to say , I 'll never be back , I will call the owner , ask him to explain his staffs behavior and why a 2 year old go kart was worth letting 4k CASH money walk out the door .	0

Took my truck in for a recall on the airbags . When I picked it up the airbag light was still on . When I asked my service advisor Aaron about it he said they did n't diagnose , just replace the bags . I asked him how he knew they were working . Said he did n't but for 125 they could stick on the computer and find out why the light is on . Why did n't you call me and ask ? Where is my complementary wash and vac ? Told me I could wait if I wanted and BTW the 125 is to diagnose only , not the repair even though it is on recall . Great service department you just bought Mr . Ewing .	0

I felt very comfortable and informed . . . . The business manager was also very pleasant and helpful . . . . . My car is exactly what I wanted and exactly what I wanted to pay for it . . . .

RIPOFF ! Just another crooked dealership that is afraid to post their real prices . They ca n't even tell that a car with 5500 miles is not new .

I 'd been living in Bali bras only bought on sale , but then had a significant birthday and decided I could spring for more expensive bras . I had never tried this on in a store , and did not buy it from amazon because the sizes are more limited here . But I ordered several new styles , promising myself I would return anything that was n't perfect . This is a terrific bra , managing the nearly impossible being sexy , plus size , and supportive as well ! I 've worn it for 12 hour stretches without any problem . The wider straps make it very comfortable , and the deep plunge make it flattering for most clothes . It 's my new go to bra , and I will definitely but it again in fact , I originally ordered the white , but then I was so happy with it I got the dark purple as wellEdited to add that I just looked at the pricing and it 's much cheaper here ! I paid full price here but my size would have been 13 cheaper here . I will definitely buy from here next time !	1

I was n't going to complain or post anything until the kind of conversation I just had with the sales man that sold me my car . I want to start off by saying that when I purchased my car a couple of years ago I had a really good buying experience . I loved my new car and was really excited about being able to purchase it after my Jeep was totaled . Martin got me into a car that was very comparable to what I was looking for in my price range . The only downfall on the car is that it is very basic and does n't have cruise control but other than that I have ZERO complaints about my car . About 4 days after I purchased my car I was rear ended by a semi truck . I was at a stop at a stop light and the driver of the truck said he though I was still going and was n't able to stop on time . I had just dropped my son off at daycare and was on my way to work . Everyone was fine and compared to what could have happened to my car it was n't horribly bad . I wanted to take it to the dealership I bought it at to do the body work . They told me they would probably have the car about 30 days in order to order parts and and they were really backed up . I had no problem with that because I wanted it fixed properly . They ended up having the car for around 90 days . It was an inconvenience but still to me it was more important that my car was fixed properly . They fixed my car beautifully and it looks amazing . You could n't even tell that it had been in an accident . They even fixed a couple imperfections that were there when I purchased the car . The shop manager asked if I was interested in having my windows tinted because he noticed they were n't done and since he had my car longer than he expected he wanted to try and make it up to me . Of coarse that sounded great but I did say that it might be a little bit before I would be able to bring the car back in since I just turned in my rental car and I need mine for work and I was getting ready to move . It was about a month and a half later and I was able to make arrangements to bring my car in . I called to make an appointment and whoever answered the phone told me they did n't have any notes of them offering me to tint my windows in my file . I asked for the shop manager to call me back since that is who is who I originally talked to and never got a call back . I tried calling back in a couple more times with no luck on getting a response back . I just let it go because I had other things I was dealing with in my personal life and did n't want to add one more thing to the list . Now the reason why I 'm posting now instead of 2 years ago . Martin called me twice last week and again today about getting me into another car or trading mine in . After having the experience I did with the body shop about the window tinting I 'm not interested in buying a car from them again . I explained this to Martin and he basically put the blame on me because if I really wanted it done I should have done it right then and there . 1st off the manager of the body shop told me it would take a couple of days to get his guys out there to do the tinting , 2nd I had to set up transpiration so I would n't be stuck away from work for a day . I work in sales myself and I know it sucks when people do n't want to purchase from you because of others mistakes but the way to over come that is to not blame your customers for someone else 's mistake . If you would have just talked to me about the situation and tried to understand where I was coming from maybe I would have gotten off the phone with a different view of the dealership but instead I got off the phone with a worse view than before .	0

i purchase a large amount of physical gift cards for my manager to give as corporate gifts thank you 's during the holidays to his staff . is there any way you or your vendor could improve the online purchasing of physical gift cards ? it 's extremely frustrating and time consumming to have to enter these orders one at a time ( key everything 35 times ) ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? i 'm afraid you might not be aware that you could be losing a lot of business . next year , it would be so much easier to just order 35 tins of popcorn from another vendor and only have to enter the billing information one time . thank you for your consideration in changing your ordering system .	0

Before I begin my bashing of this awful product , I must explain that I have many gadgets excluding this iPod touch . If my iPod touch was my sole gadget then I would need the kind of protection this case by Otterbox offers .You see there are two parts to this case , first you have a back plastic cover and a front plastic cover that also has a glass . This glass as protective as it is reduces the touchscreen sensitivity on the iPod touch . While some may argue that the camera is protected and also find the whole Apple logo fascinating from the back , I find it adds annoying bulk to the product and makes it difficult to hold .The second major component of the case aside from the hard plastic is the black rubberised skin which adds grip to the plastic assembly . This is black in color and goes over the two plastics . This makes it annoying to use because a beautiful device such as the iPod touch 4 g does n't need bulk . If you are someone who 's looking to make this sleek gadget look like an iPhone 4 , you may like this .Overall , this case does protect the phone but here are the faults there forward , a NO EASE OF USE clicking the back button in safari will be difficult because of how occupied the corners are .b REDUCED TOUCHSCREEN SENSITIVITY I found I had to OFTEN TAP THRICE to get to somethingc DIFFICULT USING ONE HAND The Otterbox makes it more difficult to maneuver this with just one hand .d FORGET ABOUT TYPING HORIZONTALLY It is a painstaking process trying to type anything with this case .e PINCHES YOUR THIGH WHILST IN POCKET No extra dialog needed .Before this I used to have the simple speck case and God , do I miss it , infact it 's back on my iPod and I 'm sending this one back to Amazon because I 'm within my 30 days .If you just have one gadget in your life and need all the protection in the world for it , go for this Otterbox but if you carry a cellphone , a wallet and an iPod touch on your person all time do some serious thinking before buying this product which really makes the whole experience flawed .	0
CONSThese shoes are the smallest size 12 I ever used and had to get a size 13 . With socks . . . forget it . But size 13 fits me perfect . Only time in my life I ever had to use size 13 .These shoes do n't have any kind of holes so they do n't breathe . Work in hot conditions with socks and they get very hot .They're not the most beautiful got the brown .The toes scratch easily .PROSAny shoes are gon na get hot .They are solidly constructed .Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and my wife thinks they 're beautiful .Of course the toes are gon na get scratched easily you twit . It 's steel there ! It buffs out easily too with polish . These are construction shoes designed to PROTECT your feet not dance with . Use a little polish if you 're concerned with what the other construction workers will think .These shoes WILL protect your toes .These shoes are LIGHT for being construction shoes .Overall , I love these shoes . The only real problem I had with them was the 12 's were too small . . . so had to go up to 13 . 13 was just perfect . Put a 15 pad in there I got from a local drug store and it feels like I 'm walking on air and suddenly I 'm as tall as George Foreman in these shoes . haha . Love these shoes and would buy them again . Just consider buying one size up from your normal size . I already have big wide feet so it 's okay . My wife says they look great !	1

I bought these to wear in my second piercing . They 're a perfect size for that purpose and a perfect shape . To me they would be a little small for a first piercing , except for a child , but everyone 's taste is different . They are so classic that they would look good as a companion to any other earring . Plus the backs seem to fit well . I 'm very happy with them .	1

John Alexander is awesome . After leasing a BMW for 3 years and owning BMW for 10 years , was actually considering trying another model . But after the great service and friendly smiles at group one Arlington , could not venture . To top it off , John found me the perfect model when I was unsure what to get . Not pushy and annoying like other dealerships . It was a fun experience and they will find you best deal to cater to your financial needs . Thanks john and BMW managers for helping me get my awesome 320 !	1

If you 're looking for a dealership with a professional staff that will treat customers with courtesy and respect , look elsewhere ! I was unfortunate enough to run into the likes of Manny Wallace .

Let me start off by saying that I have purchased these screen protectors for both my iPhone 4S and now my iPhone5 and I love them ! I wanted to start things off by giving tips to applying a screen protector properly1 If you want to put one of these on , the best time is IMMEDIATELY after buying a new phone . Do n't let the salesman / woman take off the plastic covering and skip to STEP 52 If you have already used your phone and now decided that you need a screen protector as most people are in this boat gather these suppliesRubbing Alcohol or anything else with a high alcohol content simply chemistry , alcohol evaporates quicklyLint free cloth such as silk included in this purchaseCredit Card3 Pour a small amount of your alcohol onto your lint free cloth and liberally clean all surfaces of the phone4 Repeat a few times to make sure all debris is removed from the screen5 Lift the bottom of the film from the backside side that will be touching your phone DO NOT TAKE OFF THE WHOLE FILM YET6 Place the bottom part of the cover on your phone and align it on the edges of your phone7 Use a credit card to smooth out any and all bubbles that may be present8 SLOWLY go back and fourth from using your credit card and removing a SMALL amount of the thin film from the back of the screen protector9 ! THIS IS THE STEP MOST PEOPLE MISS ! After your installation process is complete , try your best to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to really let to adhesive set . This will prevent any debris from gathering under your screen .If you followed all of those steps , you should n't have any problems getting a bubblefree screen protector ! What really sets this brand apart from the others is that they do n't have that sort of sticky feeling that most screen protectors are plagued with . You know what I 'm talking about if you 've used your friends phone and you have a hard time sliding your finger across the screen . This screen protector does not have that problem at all ! Another great feature about this product is that it prevents fingerprints . Most phones come with the coveted oliophobic coatings that are great for about a day . These protectors , since they are not glass , do not hold fingerprints anywhere near as much as glass does .Also , one thing I have noticed with a lot of screen protectors is that after a few weeks , the edges start to peel off . The screen protector my mom has on her phone something she bought at verizon gets fingerprints like crazy and puts a nasty hazy glare on her screen and after about 3 weeks , about a third of the protector started to peel away . That alone is proof to me that the quality of a screen protector DOES matter .I ca n't recmmend it highly enough !	1
Everyone says that juicing is the best way to cleanse your body , but I swear that half of the drinks are the most awful thing I have never tasted . Eager to find other ways , one of my friends told me to try a colon cleanser to help detox my body . After seeing all the positive reviews for iPurify colon cleanse , I ordered and waited for my product to come in . After a week of taking it , I feel 100 better than before . I8217 m no longer bloated all the time , and I have more energy . Also , not to mention , I have lost 3 pounds since taking it . It8217s a great form of weight loss for those who don8217 t have the time to plan a diet or go to the gym . It8217s also beneficial for your colon health . I8217 m definitely going to keep using it and recommending it to everyone I know !	1

I purchased these based upon the positive reviews . However , when I tried the slippers on , although warm , they fit too wide I have an average B width , and there is no cushioning on the soles of the feet .

The online parts department of this dealership is a big fraud . They are all over the internet advertising discounted MB spare parts . But beware . They will take your order , take your money and then you will get silence . They will not cancel your order even when they do not have the parts and / or do not intend to ship . You will need to beg to get a refund . Please avoid them like the plague .	0
I feel it 's unfortunate that there were so many positive reviews for these watches because I most likely got my hopes up on the quality of them . I was very disappointed on how they were packaged with stickers protecting the finish on the watches . I took off the stickers and the plastic to find in doing so there was stick residue left all over the watch band . Also , the watches look nice but once you feel them and see how they are made , I feel if I pulled too hard or hit it even slightly they would break . The clasp is sometimes hard and sometimes easy to come apart so you can be doing your daily tasks and it will just come unclasped . Very disappointed in these I would not recommend these to anyone .	0
horrible experience so far , tried to order a part that was needed for my motorcycle and did the research to help provide information to make it an easy process as the part was needed on somewhat of a time frame . after asking polietely for delivery date and informing them of this time frame i was told , rather dismissingly , that it will be here on wednesday or thursday . well after calling wednesday and thursday still no part . still no part on friday . now the situation has changed to , uhhhhh might be next wednesday . . . . . . . i would nt have been so upset if i would have known from the beginning that there is no estimate for delivery for whatever reason . i deal with many different parts suppliers from auto to home and 99 of the time i get the courtesty up front of an I do nt know answer if they can not give me a time frame . well thank you roseville i will not be buying any more parts and there will be a need since i am restoring some bikes or be buying a new bike from your store you have made my descision easier to go to pcp or elk grove	0

Made in China .The quality of this Samsung unit is questionable .The two halves of the case do not line up correctly , there is excess molding around the front where you insert it into the 12v cig lighter . The sticker was on crooked .I think this thing is a fake . Works fine on my Girlfriends Samsung galaxy , but does nt work on my LG . Came in a small ziploc style bag with no other information .I'd avoid it and get a different unit . I have owned samsung products in the past and they never have released anything as poorly built as this .	0

My Wife and I just engaged in our 2nd transaction with the Mark Christopher dealership in Ontario CA and it was another very pleasant experience . Mr . Gerald Waters was our salesperson for both transactions and one of the main reasons we returned . Our first transaction was about 2 years ago when we leased a 2016 Buick Verano second transaction occurred last week when we purchased a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu . I especially liked the policy where the salesperson goes thru a New Vehicle Check List , which Mr . Waters performed in a very thorough manner . We had the Buick Verano serviced twice by Mark Christopher and that was also a positive experience . I generally do n't like doing business with car dealerships but Mark Christopher is the exception . I highly recommend to anyone in the market for a lease or a purchase to visit MC and make sure to contact Mr . Gerald Waters .	1

I love having wipes handy as they 're super convenient when you do not want to take out a spray cleaner to wipe things down . I like that these are made especially for glass and are great for wiping down bathroom mirrors , and spots on windows . I would n't use these for toughtotackle jobs , but they are great for just quick everyday cleanings and wipe downs .My favorite glass cleaner is still SprayWay better than Windex ! , but I will definitely use these wipes for convenience .	1

Edit you can see my previous review below .When the watch arrived the movement was not working . I went out and paid 15 to get the battery replaced and the watch started working . It periodically would be 34 minutes off but I would adjust it and move on with my life .Then it really started getting bad , it would be off my 1545 minutes and finally completely quit . I thought , no problem I 'll just return it to Amazon ! However , I looked and saw that I was 48 hours past the return date . Ok , I thought . . . .no problem , I 'll just return it to Invicta ! Then I looked and saw that there is a 28 shipping charge for warranty service .So I bought a 50 watch , replaced the 15 battery and am now expected to pay 28 to get it fixed . No thanks . I 'm done throwing good money after bad . The watch is trash , do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The watch looks great , and that 's all that I really cared about .However , the watch arrived with a dead battery which required me to spend 15 at a jewelry store to get it replaced . When you 're buying a watch this inexpensive that 's a huge negative .It also does n't actually have a rotating dial for diving , which many of the other reviews have noted . Which begs the question , why doesn ' the seller just change the description ?	0

This is my second bad experience at this dealership in two years . Fool me once ya know . . Shame on me for going back . I tried them based purely on the reputation of Carl Sewell who literally wrote the book on customer service and I have learned my lesson . The dealership is old , small and cramped . Not the most inviting place to buy a car . The first time I tried to purchase from them they were not really interested in selling me a car when I started to negotiate price so had to buy elsewhere . This time they tried to steal my trade in . Just as other reviews have mentioned they low ball trades . You expect dealers to offer wholesale for your trade which I was fine with but my offer was nearly 9000 below dealer wholesale which I could not believe . It 's like they think they have some sort of monopoly on Lexus . I have complained directly to the sales manager Harry who ignored my first complaint and then after 2 emails passed me on to a General Manager named Gina who asked what the problem was then never responded either . It appears they prefer customers that are easy to take money from . . anything more is just too much trouble . . . I am horrified that this place has the Sewell name on it and feel bad for Carl . I do n't think anyone over there has read his book on customer serviceI went over to Park Place Lexus Grapevine the next day and PP really exceeded my expectations on trade in and customer service and on top of that the dealership facility is amazing . Had me out the door in 30 mins with my new car .	0

This thing is an excellent multipurpose tool . It works not only as a wallsocket battery charger for virtually any cellphone battery , but also as a wallsocket usb port to charge your electronic devices from 110v sockets . In addition to these functions , and uniquely from what I 've been able to find , you can charge your battery from other sources of usb power , such as a 12v car socket charger , computer usb port , or in my case a portable solar panel . This is significant because this device requires less power to charge a battery than my phone does . I carry this device everywhere in my bag , and was delighted to find something that could keep my phone running even in situations where access to power was very limited .	1

I purchased these Duracell Coppertop Duralock AA Batteries 34 Count , for our families various electronic devices that do not warrant acquiring rechargeable batteries . These particular batteries are designed to work on electronic devices that use a continuous power supply .	1
Overview A Bluetooth wireless speaker .Specs Two x 3W full range speakers as per website .Connection Connection via Bluetooth was very easy , just hold the play / pause button to sync and pair from your mobile device . Can also be connected with 25 mm audio jack .Speakers Both the box and specifications above says there are 2 speakers but if you look through the grill you can definitely see 4 speakers . There 's even a small bass port on the side . Even though these are full range speakers , they do a pretty good job of reproducing the full spectrum . I really have no complaints about sound quality .The volume is pretty amazing . It 's about the loudest I 've heard from these small Bluetooth speakers and does n't distort at the loudest volume I played it at .Design The flat design is very space saving . It 's easy to carry around and you can prop it up or lay it flat . I wish they 'd supplied two holes in the back so that you can hang it up on a wall . That would be perfect .Controls Controls are easy to use and pretty intuitive . You can control all the play / pause and ff / rewind functions from the unit .Battery life It only takes a couple of hours to charge it up and it will pretty much last the whole day , which is amazing considering the amount of sound that comes out from these speakers .Thoughts There are many of these portable speakers . What stands out most with this one is the shape . It 's easy to carry around and because it 's flat , you can just slip it into the outside pockets of your backpacks or bags . The next thing that stands out is the volume and sound that comes out from such a small product .Summary Powerful portable speakers with good dynamic range . Easy to use and control . Small footprint and the price is pretty good . Highly recommended . Sample was received for review purposes .	1
We had just gotten a new HTC EVO 4 G , and it was obvious immediately that we were going to need a case for it , especially with my clumsinessI'm always dropping or knocking a phone off of a table . Reading reviews , the OtterBox Commuter series seemed to be the best balance of quality versus price , and I priced them at our local brick mortar stores . Local prices were nearly double that of Amazon 's , making the wait for the case to be delivered worthwhile too . Amazon 's delivery , even during the busy Christmas season , was amazing with the free super shipping . I had the case delivered in 4 days ! Of course , it does help when UPS / FedEx is on the ball too .It arrived today , and my husband was sure that it was n't going to fit right . It was a breeze to get the screen cover in place and the case onto the phone . Unlike the phone itself , it also offers protective flaps in the silicone portion for the various holes for inserting things . The cut outs fit perfectly too . I love the outer coverit will keep the silicone portion from attracting every bit of lint crud possible , as well as presenting a comfortable grasp for picking up and holding the phone . It 's also attractively businesslike and not too bulky .The included screen cover definitely makes this a wise purchaselocal prices for this alone were over half of Amazon 's price for the case screen cover .I may not be sure about how much I like the HTC EVO 4 g yet , but the OtterBox Commuter case is an immediate hit ! I definitely recommend this caseyou wo n't be sorry if you get it .	1

i have to say that i did not see the convenience fee until i checked out and was not to happy with it . either way , i bought the tickets . then when i got to the theater , i still had to stand in line to get the tickets because the kiosk would not let me have them . ( i could browse only ) . there is and was nothing convenient about using the fandango and i will likely not use it again . charging me more only to have to go through the same process as everyone else ( well except the added process of using fandango , trying to use the kiosk and then having to go to the window anyway ) is not my idea of convenient	0

was very disappointed that you charge a service fee for every ticket purchased , especially when you can go directly to the theater site and they do n't have one . will not be using your service again .	0

I wish you could give a review zero stars ! This product is awful . Aside from the very pretty , but significantly wasteful packaging , I have nothing nice to say . I ripped a packet open and almost barfed from the stench . Upon opening , a puff of a chemical cloud wafted out of the tube . It reeked and made me gag . For the sake of doing a review , I poured it into a 14 oz glass of very cold water , stirred , and drank . The taste was much like I expected based on its smell . It was a very chemically taste , it felt a bit thick in that it felt like it coated my throat , and it had an awful after taste .I could n't finish more than half the glass so there is no way that I could ever do the entire 30 days . My daughter , who is 15 , tried a package , too . I did n't give her any of my feedback on the product , but she had been interested in trying it . But , she said the first sip was so awful that she could n't drink any more .I had thought that this product could be a good , healthy supplement , however , unfortunately , it is just another overpriced , pretty packaged , chemicalladen product that adds no value , and , after carefully reviewing the label , it probably does more damage than good ! And , the price is . . .well . . .INSANE ! Over 100 ? This is simply unconscionable ! I 'll stick to eating my fruits and veggies and exercising . It is hilarious to me that people are giving this review an unhelpful vote are you working for the vendor and being sent by your boss to give positive feedback ? I know folks who do that for book reviews , so it must be done for product reviews , too . Too bad . My only goal here is to help someone save their money . I am stunned at the cost of this product !	0

Zach , i have tried your number several times . It always says that leave a message . I have done that too , many times . May you please contact me . Do n't trust these guys . Bought a car in March . Still have not received the license plate and title . They said car was owned by 2 people and one of them have not signed it yet . Every time I call them they say they are going to check about it but I never hear from them . How did they even buy the car if both owners did not even signed . Car was also recalled once but they said they fixed it and removed the recall from Carfax report but issue is still there .	0

At approximately 4 long by 2 wide by 1 deep , this small charger does n't take up much room . It will fit in most bags , backpacks or pockets , and it only weighs 5 .2 oz . But it stores enough power to charge my smartphone a few times over and it does it quickly too . The last time I used it , the phone went from 53 to 100 in just a little over an hour . I also love it for charging my Kindle Fire HD and my MP3 player when I 'm away from home .There are two charging cables attached to the power bank , very convenient for those of us who constantly lose or misplace accessories like that . When not in use , they each snap neatly into the builtin indentations on either side of the device . One is a micro USB cable and the other , an Apple Lightning Charging cable . I do n't own anything from Apple so I charge my electronics one at a time with the micro USB cable but if you do , you would be able to take advantage of both cables simultaneously . Included is a USB to micro USB cable for charging the power bank itself . It works just fine but I 've also found that the charger that came with my phone will do the job as well .This is definitely one handy little device and I make it a habit never to leave home without it .	1

I 'm already a fan of 34Source Naturals34 products anyway , but I 've been sold on this stuff for about 2 years now . I had suspected for years that I had a condition called 34leaky gut34 , I knew there was n't much that could be done to 34cure34 it . Having studied alternative medicine for years I knew that enzymes were one of the few methods that research studies had noted as being effective . So after trying several other methods I finally resorted to this supplement . Wow . . . just wow . After about 6 months , of taking one pill before each meal only meals , not snacks , not only did I start to gain weight for the first time in my life , after having been VERY underweight for years I 'm very tall , I was very thin , but I felt better than I had ever felt before I swear I could actually begin to 34feel34 the vitamins I had been taking starting to work ! Even though I 'm quite sure that I would probably be alright if I stopped taking these , now that my body chemistry has corrected itself , I continue to take these on a daily basis though not at every meal . After you hit about 30 yrs old a person 's body starts losing enzymes at an alarming rate , especially if you do n't eat many raw vegetables / or fruits , so I decided to continue an enzyme regiment , at one pill per day . . . I have continued to maintain a healthy weight , feel phenomenal .About 2 yrs ago I was 6 ' 634 weighed about 165 to 170 lbs . . Now I weigh , same height , of course , lol , right around 215 to 220 lbs have a good , athletic build .As a final word Now do n't get the wrong idea about enzymes . They do n't make a person GAIN weight , enzymes help a person balance their weight , help break down food into the most beneficial efficient form the body can absorb utilize . Granted , a person COULD potentially continue to gain unwanted weight if they did n't get regular exercise , but as a personal testament , I have REALLY packed on some good muscle bulk weight by watching my diet exercising regularly while taking these enzymes .	1

which appears to be intentional since the diameter of these batteries is just a bit too large for SureFires which take C123A batteries .I gave these one star because everything I read indicated they are compatible with C123a batteries . They are not .There are some excellent technical reviews that have been posted in amazon indicating that misrepresentations of the capabilities of these and other 18650 batteries are rife . Read them and weep .	0
Sound quality is terrible for this price . It basically sounds like the cheap wired headphones that ship with most smartphones .Fit / comfort falls short of what I expected . the units do not stay snug to the ears , no matter how you turn or twist them .Strap is too long . It basically sits awkwardly around your neck or below your cheeks and feels wierd . Why does it have to be that long ? Size of the units are huge . Do n't be fooled by the tiny picture on the box .Final verdict returned with a loss in shipping . Thanks Amazon .	0
Does the job better than any other case I 've used . Seems like it took a long time to arrive , though .	1
I bought this flashlight after seeing all the advertising for Maglite . What a disappointment ! It is small and puts out maybe 20 lumens of light , if that . The lumens are so low that Maglite never even lists the lumens on any of its products , unlike its competitors .This thing might make a decent booklight but that is not what I bought it for . For the same price at this overhyped , underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful !	0
Great experience ! Recommend Baron !	1
I will continue to update this review as the days and or months pass by of me using the Marpac SleepMate . But for now I will give my initial thoughts on the device .I was n't really sure what to expect from this , I must have read over 600 reviews from several different MarPac sleepmate products here on Amazon there is another with over 1 , 000 reviews for the 980 model which is essentially the same thing and I even scoured the net searching for other reviews . Some would say it is too quite , while others would say it is too loud . And I was n't sure what I truly needed or what review to trust for ' loudness judgment ' .However what I gathered from most of these reviews is that typically people who use fans as a source of constant ' white ' noise to sleep or concentrate , all fell in love with this device . I happen to be one of those people who needs to use a fan every night . Even if it 's literally freezing outside I will have my fan running , in my window , all night , just so I can enjoy the constant sound conditioning a fan provides . But a fan really is n't the best answer , it uses up quite a bit of energy if you leave it on for hours upon hours mind you I am using a big box fan I got from WalMart . Plus when it 's cold outside , using the fan will make it cold inside ! So the fact that fan people , such as myself , like this product , really gave me incentive to try it out .Before I go into my thoughts on the device , I will provide some background as to why I wanted a noise generator in the first place . Obviously for the reason stated above , this seemed like a better option than a fan . Less energy consumption , no cold air blowing around , and a more consistent smooth sound since fans can often rattle , vibrate or cause other annoyances . Another reason I wanted to try it out is because I absolutely CANNOT stand random barking dogs in my neighborhood . It seemed like every night and day there was a new dog barking from a new direction at varying volumes , times and tones . And each time one of these dogs barked it resonated back and fourth in my head and I could n't focus on anything but the barking . Mix that with the fact that there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop the dogs barking aside from fantasizing about walking to the barking dogs house and punching the owner in the face . So I had absolutely no control over the situation and it drove me insane , as I was at the mercy of these barking dogs . Did n't matter if I was trying to sleep or using the computer , the sound of those dogs barking was killing me . I usually turn my fan on at day and night to drown out any unnecessary noise , but this time of year it is simply too cold outside to use it in that manner , so I just had to endure through all the noise abuse .Anyway , on to the product . So far I am enjoying it . It is plenty loud for me much louder than my box fan at the Marpac 's highest volume and is very smooth and consistent . Although when I crank it up all the way there is a slightly highpitch noise it makes , it 's very hard to notice but I have very good hearing and can pick out any little sound within a sound . It 's not so much a high pitch sound like you would imagine , more of a plasticsounding screech / whine noise imagine blowing on the edge of a bottle that has a small opening . It 's hard to explain , but if I listen hard enough I can even hear it on the lower level . It is far from overpowering and I only notice it when I really listen to the machine . Plus this sound seems to only be localized in one part of my room for whatever reason . As for masking unwanted sounds , so far it seems to be doing it 's job . It does n't over up the really loud noises of course , but the noise from all the distant barking dogs in my neighborhood have all been eliminated .Also take note that this device does not blow out air from the holes , is SUCKS in the air through the holes . It really does n't sound like a fan , it sounds more like a air conditioner almost identical in fact . Another note about the device is that mine came with a foam padded bottom not rubber feet . And while I do hear some minor resonating vibrations from my wooden bedside thing not sure what to call it the ' hum ' is no problem at all for me and is barely distinguishable / noticeable . My box fan had at least three times the hum of this device .Anyway , that is all for now , I will update if I have anything else to add as I use it . Tonight will be the first night I sleep with it on , so we 'll see how that goes .	1
Let me tell you something about this place . I 've tried for the past two weeks . To get my right case for my cell phone . And the first order he sent me the screen protector that was fine the two cases he sent me were no good they did not fit . My cell phone which is a droid 2 . So I said that I wanted to send back your the two cases that do n't fit . And he said no he sent me another clear case that did n't fit either . And I must 've told him in three emails they did not fit . So I have her back to him since I emailed them telling him the second clear case does not fit a droid 2 global . So I gave up on it . He does not want me to do a preview of his product . Place no good . Sincerely Thomas . PS at this point I do n't care what the guy does I 'll never buy another from an outfit . That 's for sure ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0

I got these for my fiance because she has an obsession with fuzzy socks and other warm things for her feet . For the price and getting a pack of 6 , I think they are really great . There was another oneSoft and Warm Microfiber Fuzzy Socks in Your Choice of Royal Blue , Purple or Red By Foot Trafficwe ordered too that was half of the price but only had one sock . It was noticeably softer and smoother than these socks . For the price and quantity of these , even if they do eventually wearout faster than normal like some other reviewers said , you still got them for really cheap price and I 'm very happy with the purchase .	1

I bought a 2004 Jeep Wrangler in January then parked it until about 2 weeks ago because I was out of town . When I took it to have new wheels and tires put on the mechanic said rear axle needed to be rebuilt , front and rear pinion seals leaking and front brakes had less than 5 and rotors were shot . I took it back to Baxter with less than 100 miles since purchase and I was told buying used means AS IS . It did n't matter that it was a huge safety factor . I took it to another mechanic and they agreed it should have never been put on the lot with these issues . If you are buying used , take the vehicle to your own mechanic before you buy . I wo n't be back .	0

I am extremely athletic and muscular , so the McDavid Knee Stabilizer would n't work because it 's not adjustable . This brace is fully adjustable and has provided the support and flexibility I needed . As a matter of fact , my acupuncturist was so pleased with my progress while wearing the brace , she ordered 3 more for her other clients ! I wear it when I do anything that will put a lot of strain on my knee where I would need that extra support dancing , running , hiking , etc . . It 's been great .	1
Like what everyone else says . . . these blades are sharp . I 've been using Merkur blades and on a whim I 'd thought I 'd try these . They are so sharp that any amount of pressure will slice through anything . If you think you 're man enough to dare and try one of these blades , remember to not put any pressure on it when you shave , just use the weight of the blade or slightly redue the weight of the blade to shave . You will be shoocked at how sharp these are .	1

Bought a Braun foil shaver last year , after deciding it was better for the price at the time . . . .how mistaken I was . That unit shaved very poorly and in alot of cases left hair , so I never had an even shave . I finally was able to get the 1280x and boy did I get a great unit . I regret not getting it sooner but with just the first shave , a dry one at that , the shave was 10X better than that Braun . The unit is alot quieter as well . If you want to buy a razor that gives you a good close shave , then get a Norelco like this one . You will not regret it	1

These things got such bad reviews that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one at least they 're cheap . I gave them two stars instead of one since , oddly , 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose a size adapter for my iPhone , though none of them work when plugged into my PC . Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less . . .UPDATE Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous . All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly . A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer . . .	0

I surmise that when their dog is n't barking continuously on its own , they 're standing in the yard yelling ' speak ' and throwing meaty tidbits her way .In addition , one child is always toting a boombox , blaring rap , while the other is bouncing a basketball off the side of their house , sometimes for eight hours straight , often running onto my porch to impress me with his dribbling skills . I think the neighbor behind me is in the top five , too . He 's taken up drums , and on the weekend he moves his stereo , complete with auditorium sized speakers and subwoofer , onto his patio for my enjoyment . Ah , yesthis is the good life ! Okay , okay . . .maybe it is just me , and this is the normal hum of ' daylight living , ' from which I 've become so removed . I do a lot of 12 hour night shift work , and I ca n't expect the world to come to a screeching halt because I 'd like a little sleep . But , something had to give ! Something did ! My new Marpac 980 recently arrived and I could n't be more satisfied . It is small and portable , but solidly built , with cushioning on the bottom to prevent vibration , or furniture scaring . The instructions are clear regarding how to adjust the volume quality , with the top rim and collar . It also has a low and high setting switch . I set mine on the highest level . . .remember , my neighbors are in the top five .For such a small machine , the sound really fills the room and there are n't any quirky artifacts , or rattles . The sound is consistent and pure . I quickly adjusted to this new , distraction from the madness , and found it quite comforting .On the very first trial , a water main had broken close to my home . There were Public Service workers with their , noisy Bobcat , digging to China for hours . I could barely hear them . Ah , the sound of success .If your neighborhood enters the contest , you might just want to consider one of these machines , too . Sleep deprivation is bad for both mental and physical health . Just ask me .Update 11 / 19 / 10 My first Marpac unit is still going strong , and I have since ordered a second one . I think I 'm addicted ! I do n't only use them to sleep with , now . I use one anytime I feel like blocking out the outside worldlike when reading , studying , or searching for a Zen moment . These units still receive my highest recommendation . I will never be without them , until they are extracted from my cold , lifeless hands .	1

My name is Bond , I had my car BMW Z4 for last 6 years n I have no a single problem with it . . . it 's drivable n everything r fine . . . about 3 weeks ago I just found out that my convertible does n't work . So I brought my car to the San Antonio dealer to fix it n testing about water leaking . And Tony who work on my car told me that my car need replacing battery n water leaking testing n other stuff . Finally we agreed on the price with 4000 . Then 1 week later they told me my car all fix up n pick up on Monday June 5th , 2017I pick it up n drove back to work n suddenly my car completely shutdown while I 'm on highway 410 . Luckily I did n't hit by a trailer or truck . It is terrifying when ya car suddenly did n't response or do anything in a middle highway . . . just let everyone know that my car was drivable n i all want is fix the convertible top . Thanks GOD I still ALIVE . People can kill because of poor mechanical technician who do not do good job , especially BMW brand . I and other people trust BMW people n realize on them . . . what if they irresponsible on what ya doing about mechanical skill . I paid 4000 , look what i got . Almost kill my self for it . I call them back on next DayTuesday June 6th , they pick my car n until now 1 week later they can not even tell me what wrong ?	0

I got this watch for a temporary period . But after having got this , I did not feel that I need another one , except for the time when I go out for a party or a formal meeting . The date , dual time is very useful . I had set one for US and other for my client 's timezone . Its well fitting , and comfortable . The price on Amazon is also the best ! Recommended !	1
I agree with Ali Raza , I was also charged nearly 5000 . 00 in past and my car was not fixed . I requested my replacement parts right after the service but they were not able to give me the old bad parts . My car was diagnosed for a engine light on , they diagnosed and quoted Around 1200 . 00 , next day they call me and they said they found some more issues which will cost me additional money otherwise my engine light will stay on , I gave permission for further repairs and requested to keep all old parts which they never gave to me when I went to pickup the car . I live very close to BMW mainline , after pickup the car I came back to home , next morning it wo n't starts again . They towed it back to dealership , next day they told me they have fixed the car , when I went to pickup they told me they replaced some more engine parts and I have to pay more money . Again they were not able to give me the old bad parts they claimed they changed . I payed the rest of my balance and drive off , I decided to drive for couple minutes to make sure their is no more issue and guess what , the engine light came on again . I called about that and service manager suggests me to trade in the car for a new one with them or they can re diagnose for further issues . He said they can diagnose it further but I have to pay for diagnose again and have to pay for additional repairs . I never went back and today I 'm ready to take my car to a non dealership place to check what is actually wrong with my car . I want to request to all people please starts asking for your old replacement parts . Tell them upfront you want to take pictures of your old parts before they dispose them . This way we consumers could save a lot of trouble and there are more chances we can avoid dealship scams .	0

I was a little surprised to see that others here have purchased it for use in their home beds as I have , rather than for a massage table . So my review is from that perspective , using it at home in my bed . This was the best purchase I have made in a long time . Despite a problem that happened in shipping the delivery got delayed and the tracking was messed up with both UPS and USPS claiming to have the box , the product itself is fantastic . I should have bought this a long time ago ! I have Fibromyalgia and also Hypothyroidism , and generally lousy circulation it seems , and I am always cold . My feet especially are freezing all the time , and getting to sleep at night is miserable because I shiver for a couple of hours before I can warm up enough to sleep . I have an electric blanket , but it only does so much .After a couple professional massages that were so warm and soothing , I realized the table warmer was a great idea for home . This particular model was a very reasonable price as I only desired something basic . It 's single wide , which is perfect for me because I do n't have to heat the entire bed I only sleep on one side . The bottom is a feltlike woven material that holds it 's place nicely on the bed and the top is a very soft , thick fleece . It has four corner elastics meant for a massage table which I do n't use . After some debate , I decided to try it on top of my bottom sheet rather than under it , in case I need to adjust it , although it 's needed very little adjusting . It really holds in place nicely . I do n't feel the wires through it while lying down at all , it 's plush and comfy .While the power cord to the outlet is plenty long , the cord that goes from the pad to the remote is quite short , less than 2 feet for sure , so you 'll have to set it nearby or tuck it somewhere . I keep it right above my head on the bed since I do n't move around in bed that much . It has a high , low and off , and also a reset button . The high is as others have said , nice and toasty ! But I disagree with others who feel the low setting is useless I think it 's also very warm , just lower of course . I find the best method is to start off with it on high and then leave it on low later when you 're already warmed up . Anyway , the autotimer turns it from high to low . I 've tried timing it , and I believe it turns to low in just less than one hour , after about 50 minutes it seems . It does not autooff , only to low . But the reset button is super handy , you can just push it at any time and it switches back to high and starts the timer all over again . If it 's already on high it simply starts the timer again . Unlike the low / high / off slide switch , the reset button is raised and easy to push in the dark to reset . I did n't like the idea of the autotimer at first , but the easy reset button has changed my mind .I turn this on a while before I get into bed and it heats up nicely and also heats my top sheet . Getting into bed is now pure joy . It 's incredibly toasty and warm and even my ice cold feet are warm within minutes . No more shivering in bed trying to sleep . It 's actually improved my sleep tremendously because as I said , it would take me a very long time to sleep because I was so darn cold . This is like heaven . The only thing I would suggest is to turn it off after a while , because the couple times I 've left it on all night I 've woken up the next morning sweating ! I really thought this thing would be moving around all over the place under me but it does n't , it stays put and works wonderfully .I literally look forward to getting into bed every night now , it 's such a joy on my achy muscles to be enveloped by soft warmth . I really have no complaints , it 's a fantastic product and works better than I had hoped . My cold feet love it too .	1

Cadillac XT5Like everyone else , I did plenty of research before heading to the dealership . I was already a Cadillac owner . Ed McMullin took the sales process one step higher . Despite the fact that I was already planning to buy an XT5 , he was thorough about explaining all of the features , improvements since the SRX and completely impressed me with his knowledge of the car and enthusiasm for the car . He is the only car salesman I can say I have been impressed by . I will definitely refer my friends and family to him . Sadly , however , I 'm the only Cadillac owner among my F / F . Maybe that will change once they speak with Ed ! Thanks Ed !	1

This scale offers a great mix of readability , standing area and value . I purchased this as an 80th birthday present for a healthconscious family member . For this recipient , the scale needed a large standing area along with a visible readout . This scale easily meets both requirements . There is one note of caution , however . Prospective purchasers should check the location they intend to place this scale . It may not fit into that existing corner of your bathroom occupied by a typical bathroom scale .ProsLarge standing areaHighly visible backlit screenModest priceNo additional switchesConsTakes up significant floor space	1

At 15 K my Porsche developed etching on the silver door trim and I raised the issue with Porsche Bellevue . The dealership informed me that this issue is not covered by the warranty and suggested that I contact Porsche USA to see if they can help . Fair enough . I spoke with Porsche USA about the issue and after a few back and forth they informed me that they can not help and suggested that I speak with the dealership . Great . I contacted Porsche Bellevue again asking how I should proceed . However , at this point the dealership even did n't bother to acknowledge my emails and calls . I tried to raise the issue again with Porsche USA but they did n't return my emails either . This is not how any company should treat its customers , especially a company like Porsche .	0

It stays on the foot without flopping and is constructed without pinching , rubbing , hurting .The best part for me is that I have a Morton 's neuroma on one foot and this shoe has a slight raised area at the toe joint that eliminates any pain while wearing this shoe . It has duel use as a regular walking shoe and a water shoe . For me , it is the best !	1
My nether region has never felt so pampered ! Now , I will say that at the time of writing this , the price has shot up considerably from when I did purchase it . However , can you really put a price on the comfort of the places that you use toilet paper ? I think not ! This stuff is both soft and durable . No worries about your fingers going through it or leaving a residue of lint in an embarrassing location . Also realize this is for 40 rolls of toilet paper ! Holy cow , how long does it take to go through 40 rolls of toilet paper ? It took my family of three about 4 months to go through it , and we used it for everything from various wiping to blowing our noses .Even at the current price of my writing this review , it 's not that bad of a deal . I tracked the price of it for the last year , and the graph looked like a NYC skyline , so if you do n't like the price now , keep an eye on it . It will be a price you will like , soon enough . Whether through having a thicker wallet , or through the luxurious feeling that is comparable to wiping yourself with silk , your butt will be happier if you make this purchase at some point !	1

I have never in my life been so DISGUSTED with the service demonstrated by this establishment . My poor father has been car less for three months due to this service center . After receiving hail damage to his car more than three months ago my father took his Lexus here to get fixed and for three months now has been without a car . The insurance company has given them almost 15k to fix his car and you would think they would try and provide him with the most efficient service and we have seen nothing but poor quality service . The insurance company would only pay for a rental car for a month and you would think that Lexus would offer a courtesy car or company car for him to use since they were incapable of fixing his car in that amount of time but not once have they offered any alternative , instead it has now been three months of having to borrow other family members vehicles . I am so appalled , I will NEVER recommend this service center , car dealer or even Lexus in general to any person because with the amount of money one invests into purchasing a Lexus the service provided should reflect that investment . I will be sure to take to all social media sites this TERRIBLE experience we have had to ensure that this complaint is heard so that no one has to ever experience what we have been through with this business .	0

I taught school for 41 years . You can imagine what a bug barn a school is . For years I suffered colds and frequently what ever flu was going around . Two years before I retired I got a bacterial infection in a tooth . The dentist wanted to pull it . I said No . Reading that garlic has fairly strong antibacterial properties I decided to try that first . I took 20 Garlic gelcaps a day . It took a year but the infection in my tooth went away . But I noticed I had n't had any colds that year either . So I continued with the garlic though I cut the amount to 10 gelcaps coupled with 800 mg of vitamin D . That was 11 years ago , I 've been cold and flu free since . My Doctor quit even asking me if I wanted a free flu shot . This past year he said he had written a report on me and was starting Garlic he already used the D himself . But in order to take garlic and not smell to the high heavens I 've found that only Spring Valley Oderless garlic works . Others claiming to be oderfree are NOT .	1

The sales experience was awesome . However , if your trading another Mercedes for a new one Park Place ca n't transfer your personalized license plates , so you have to take a day off work to transfer your license plate . Ridiculous .

My husband and I purchased a car here in 2015 . We also purchased an extended warranty . We have since traded that vehicle in and are entitled to a refund of what was left on the warranty . We have been in contact with the warranty company who told us that they have released our refund to the dealership and they are to give us the money . After weeks of as run around , being told the person that I need to talk to is out of town , and even being hung up on , it looks like we will be taking legal action to receive the money that is rightfully ours . In addition to that there were multiple problems with it only weeks into owning it . I do n't know how a dealership sells cars and treats people in this way . DO NOT BUY FROM THEM ! ! !	0

I am a huge Teva fan and have about 4 pairs in the original thong style . I wanted something a little more strappy and decided to give these a try since I already really enjoy Teva sandals . These did not disappoint . I have a wide foot so the straps need to be stretched out a bit so it took a few wears until they fit my feet better . After that they were perfect . I live in the city so I do a lot of walking and wanted something that would n't give me a ton of blisters . These worked well and have such a thick sole that there is no way these ca n't be comfortable for a days walk . Would recommend to anyone who does a lot of walking and wants I slightly nicer , very comfortable flip flop .	1

I do not have a dishwasher machine so i m constently washing dishes at least 2 times a day having purchased these gloves i thought they would save my hands and nails from getting dry and nail polish chipping faster . at first i would say there okay for the first few days but after that i noticed they started to stick like old moldy water they take forever to dry in between dish washing loads so when i put my hands in they feel slimey cold and wet its gross to know i m putting my hands in bacteria breeding ground i have to wash my hands after no matter what its impossible to turn them inside out and let them dryalso i have longer nails and i like to get fake ones every now and then and they started to tear at the finger tips but i tested this out i bought a fresh new pair for my sister she has super short nails and they started to do the same thing for her tear and the finger tips and mold insideI would maybe use these for gardening or maybe another activity you need to protect your hands inoverall i would not purchase these for myself to wash dishes in	0

I bought these thinking they might be a little better quality and wear better than the Stafford brand I normally get from JC Penny . We 'll they 're not . . .and they do n't .I was a bit surprised too since I normally find the Dockers brand to be pretty good . After only a couple washings they lost the soft thick feel they had when new . Even the Dockers logo in unreadable now . I have Stafford Ts that are years old , and the logo is still clear .I went back to the Stafford Ts and will relegate these to the rag pile . They should be fine for dusting and cleaning .A bit pricey for that though .	0

Every time my iPhone or iPad get smudged with fingerprints , grease or dirt , I simply rub it across my jeans or shirt . It 's not the most attractive or efficient way to clean an expensive device . These 3pack cleaning pads are very well made . Look at the price and then think about how important it is to clean your device properly . It 's a nobrainer bargain .Simply place your fingers in the pocket and clean your device . The premium ' microfiber removes all residues . NO scratches , no smudges , no worries . It will work with any device that has a clear screen similar to an Apple product . Have one at home near your office desk , one at work and extra around the house . They do n't need to be cleaned often , but s simple solution of ordinary dish soap and water sand air drying should handle that . It a nice little accessory hat I never would have though about before . The cleaning pad will easily fit in an iPad case or similiar .

I bought this thinking it would be the best car charger because it was approved by ATT . I was completely wrong . I would be driving and I would constantly hear my phone vibrating . I would check my phone , only to see that I was n't getting any calls or texts . Finally , I realized it was vibrating because the charger kept turning on and off ! After a halfhour drive , my phone would go from being at 40 to being at 41 . Horrible quality , and I am definitely unsatisfied . I would recommend not wasting your money on this nonworking product .	0
After receiving a referral from a friend , we just had the best car buying experience ever ! We completed an online application for financing received immediate approval a call from Kriss Arbury . We scheduled a convenient appointment to go in see Kriss who was very friendly professional helped us find the perfect car without any pressure . Next we saw Arturo Gutierrez in finance he was also extremely friendly helpful offered us many options . Lastly we had the pleasure of meeting Anthony who helped us with all of the features our new car had to offer . We had an excellent experience highly recommend MercedesBenz of The Woodlands will definitely take our future business there as well .	1

i 'm not sure why your developer thought it was a good idea to set a delay on showing the words get 'em while we got 'em . guarantee your tickets . after the page loads , but he she should place a container around the div class tsp offer div and set it to the appropriate height so the tags below it do n't shift . i went to select a theater 3 times as the page loads ( 3 separate page loads obviously ) and ended up clicking on the my theaters tab because it moved to where the theater select is . it 's really just annoyance .	0
This battery is supposed to have nearly double the capacity of the OEM . It is big and it did take a very long time to charge . I followed the instructions to the letter and when I finally tried it out in my phone , it lasted until about 3 pm on standby with WiFi on . That is just slightly longer than my old , pathetic original battery .I do n't care if my test was not scientific . If a battery does n't make it through a whole day of service , especially 99 standby , then it should never be manufactured . . .period . I could n't help but notice that Amazon tried to prevent me from writing a product review on this . In my orders , there was no button for a review when all other orders have that button . Is this an agreement with Hyperion to censor ?	0
The reason I gave 1 star rating is because one finance manager named Jamil Najd just did not want to work with a customer . We paid off already 7 cars for last 3 years cash never a late payment . Seriously , a car for 36000 with down payment of 5k and we thought to put in some more k 's , but even then he denied us ! How is it possible with cosigner with excellent credit score ? I never received this terrible customer service before . The other dealerships are always fighting for their customers , sales or financial it does not matter . Not all the people are millionaires and all people have different situations and everything depends on financial management to work out the best solution with the bank . But it seems like Jamil was n't willing to do all he could to satisfy a customer	0

For those of you who say it does not stay on and it falls off , Are you kidding me ? I can not even take this thing off my windshield anymore . It is so attached to the windshield that it feels as if it was put there by Honda .The combination of sticky suction cup and the suction action make this stick very well .CAREFUL This means that you better know for sure where you want to put it , as removing it is going to be a bit of work .One handed operation This is a great feature and easy to useAdjustable foot You can move the foot to be wide or narrow depending on your phone and where the microphone or headphone plug is on your phone .Adjustable height This feature enables you to adjust the phone so that the volume button are not blocked .The mount sits tight on has not become loose .Length of the arm This is the only thing I would say you need to think about before buying this mount . This mount does not have a long arm so it would not be a good fit in my Toyota Sienna as the distance from windshield to dash is longer than a sedan car . In those type of cars you need to look for a flat surface on the dash to be able to mount this . It is however a good fit for my Honda Civic . I have it on the left side of the windshield and I can reach the phone fine . However in a car like the Civic 2012 there is hardly any flat surface to mount this thing on the dash . Only place to mount is Windshield .Altogether I think this is a great mount .	1

Many people have reviewed this watch , I wanted to have an anadigi watch with the negative display and this Casio does it 's job well . There are a lot of complaints about the negative digital numbers / display being too dark and on other Casio 's the numbers are brighter . If that 's what you want then get the other watch , it 's not that big of a problem . Sure the hands are going to block the digital display as well at certain times of the day but it is expected . It does take awhile for the hands to rotate when setting the piece when holding the button down but honestly , how many times do you do it ? All in all I like it , it 's accurate and is a Gshock , have bumped it several times on metal file cabinets and shelves at work , the high bezel keeps the crystal from getting scratched or broken from a direct hit . If you need a classic analog and like digital as well , buy this one .	1
I read the numerous glowing reviews figured if they are having such luck I should try it . I 'm from Ky , where we have one of the world 's most notable bad allergy seasons . This one especially because of the unusually heavy rain we 've endured . I have to assume everyone else that had a glowing review must live someplace else , because these little magical wands did nothing for me . Every year I get a serious allergy attack when the tree pollen comes out to play . It 's a hellish week long battle of snotty wetness , sleeplessness , and a chapped face from all the nose blowing . Every year I end up developing a sinus infection related to my allergy relief failing to slake the snot BEFORE an infection sets in the clear funk turns to a thick awful yellow mess . This year , in hopes of avoiding that , and a trip to the doctor where I cuss them out for giving or suggesting me stuff that makes it worse before it 's better , I decided to try something new different . These overpriced swabs are pretty much useless . They just add to the already existing watery wetness that is otherwise streaming out of my face . At the very least its a very expensive way to condition my tender mucus membranes , but I could use petroleum jelly for that it would be vastly cheaper equally effective . I have n't slept well in two days these failed to give me any relief whatsoever . And for those of you who suggest I should give them more time to work , exactly how long should one wait for relief ? I would say after a day something should show improvement . This failed miserably .	0

If you 're reading this review chances are like me you have found great , well fitting TShirts near impossible to find and crazy expensive when you do come across them .On a lark I ordered two of these is black at a size 2X . The style , fit and quality are superb . Thick well dyed non clingy 100 cotton . The pocketless front and well crafted crew neck makes these ideal for tucked in under a jacket or sport coat . Worn on their own or under a vest , these are versatile wonderfully affordable well made garments .The cotton is extremely soft , not stiff at all and does n't pill . Right of the package they are completely comfortable . I 'm a big guy and like my TShirts long far to often I buy tall 's and they 're too short , not the case here .These are long enough without looking like nightshirts ! Yet also nice to sleep in .I would highly recommend this brand for price , quality and value as you 're sure to enjoy them . I ' have already ordered more in different colors and will contiune to purchase them that 's for certain .	1

This is absolutely beautiful ! I got it as a gift for my sister and opened it up and oh my word it is really really pretty . Hefty without being bulky , the perfect size for a large pendant , it 's just truly beautiful .The clasp is more an ordinary clasp like for a regular chain I do n't know if that 's normal for silver omega chains I thought it would be something more secure like for pearls or the gold omega I have . But it does n't detract from the beauty of the piece .As a gift or an essential part of your own jewelry collection this is a beautiful rendering of a basic piece .	1

I have several different brands of USB car chargers , and this Tudia dual port model is one of the more distinctive looking ones . When plugged into my car 's power adapter , the front lights up with labels to indicate which port is 2 .1 A and which is 1 .0 A . The 2 .1 is best for charging power hungry devices such as the iPad , although it can be used for phones as well . The cyan blue silcone stripes make it easy to find in a console full of stuff . But , of course , the appearance does n't matter if the device does n't work and it does . Beautifully .The Tudia charger fits snugly but does n't require a lot of effort to plug in . Likewise , the USB ports seem solid and wellconstructed I do n't have to struggle to plug in my power cables . My iPhone gets charged lightningquick with its lightning cable , of course ! , just as if it were plugged into a home outlet . I like that it powers off when a device if fully charged and that it does not get hot or make noise .With people carrying more and more devices on the road tablets , phones , cameras , Kindles it becomes important to be able to charge more than one at a time , particularly if there are two of you . Before I had a dual port charger , my husband and I would have to take turns charging our phones , and we usually ended up arguing who needed the charge more . Now one port belongs to him , and the other to me . Thanks , Tudia , for the marriage counseling ! Note I received a sample for review . Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1

I had my Can am took in for repairs due to accident . Repair was quoted a little over 4 , 000 and after insurance agreed to the repair . Cost came in higher and had to go back to insurance co . I had full coverage and I told Justin I wanted it repaired as new . When son went to pick it up it was not to my satisfaction . I wish I had not had it taken there . I would not recommend them . I was the owner and I told Justin service clerk on prior visit what I wanted , I feel he did not communicate my expectations to Eddie the service manager .

Having a major issue with the timing chain on my 2007 Cadillac SRX with 84k miles . Received an OTB error P0017 and P0018 that there was an issue with the timing chain , after which I reached out to a local mechanic and Cadillac . The local mechanic confirmed that those codes were an issue with the timing chain system itself and he was extremely surprised to see a Cadillac with on 84k miles on it having to already replace the timing chain system . After doing a little more research , saw there was a recall that started back in 2011 for this SAME KNOWN PROBLEM . Apparently the recall was extended out 10 years or 120 , 000 miles from the original purchase date and expired 5 months ago with my Cadillac only having 84 , 000 miles on it . I was told there was nothing Cadillac can do and would be a roughly 2 , 500 repair that I would have to pay out of pocket . I would expect this from a lowend or average car brand , but I thought Cadillac prides themselves on being a premium and dependable car brand . For a vehicle with such a high rapport , I would expect the same level of service , as should all consumers of luxury vehicles . The thing that bothers me most is their blatant refusal to repair a known mechanical and design flaw . A timing chain should last for the relative lifetime of a vehicle if properly maintained , which it has been . Not half the life . This is not my mistake , it is your mistake . Fix it . In summary , the flagship brand of a 50 Billion car manufacturer with a reputation built since 1908 is being stingy over 5 months and 2 , 500 after we bailed them out for 11 Billion ? ? ? Cadillac , in all fairness I 'm willing to give you a chance to redeem yourself . I 've loved this car and everything its done for me and my family . I 'm 25 years old and I was planning on being a lifetime consumer . Let 's try and figure out an appropriate resolution .	0

Never again ! I wish I could leave ZERO STARS ! I am very upset over my last experiences with Rothrock , specifically the service department . I scheduled an appointment for my 3month old 2017 Nissan Rouge , regarding my hatch door latch malfunctioning . When I arrived I met with Walt Schlener , who informed me that this my not be under warranty . I have bumper to bumper I 've owned my vehicle for 3 months are you kidding me ? . . . so in addition to my scheduled appointment for them to fix my hatch , I asked to also have an oil change done . . . OK . After an hour Walt comes out and tells me I have expensive property i . e . Camera and laptop on my backseat , they are unable to remove and since their techs leave at 5 pm , now they do not have time to look at the hatch . They simply stalled for an hour and then told me it was too late , instead of asking me to move the two very small items . Well , they got the oil change done which could 've been done after . My hatch was my main concern and the reason for my visit . I drove out of my way and left work early to make a 330pm appointment so they could look at and fix my hatch . This was not done ! Complete waste of my time I will not be referring anyone to Rothrock .	0
Rude and unprofessionalI considered purchasing a car from this dealership . My client advisor Jacob Raykhel lied to me and told me that another customer was in the lobby waiting to buy the car if I did not . After I decided that I did not want to go through with the purchase , Jacob wrote me an incoherent email calling me stupid and cheap . I complained to the manager , Jamie Dougherty , and he did nothing to rectify the situation . I called BMW of North America to file complaint against the dealership and the employees that I mentioned above . They did not seem to care .	0

Well , I am That guy . . . . I have bought three new Hyundai 's since 2013 , two here an one someplace else . I have had two horrible experiences here and should have learned from my past , but I went back one more time in early August . . . . . Last year , I attempted to purchase a vehicle here and their floor manager jerked me around for two weeks after my financing was approved . So I went to the guys on Coors and the experience was seamless . So , why did I come back here ? ? They had the vehicle I wanted . This time everything was approved on August 7th , gave them a huge down payment which they cashed in two days . Did't pay off my trade in for almost one month . No response on them about the problem even with many , many voice mails left and a face to face meeting . It took me filing a complaint with the Attorney Generals office for them to finally respond . Total stress for me and what should have been an enjoyable experience for me turned into a two month nightmare . STAY AWAY . I am sure I will get a nice message posted here from them explaining how sorry they are abut it , but it does not change my experience one bit .	0

I bought this for making homemade muscle rub . As it 's pure camphor oil , I expected this to have a strong medicinal smell and cause a warming sensation on the skin .When I got the package I was surprised to find that the smell was n't very strong , so I diluted some of this with a carrier oil and applied topically . Felt nothing . Then I just put a straight drop on my inner arm .Still nothing .Maybe I got a defective batch , maybe I 'm crazy and do n't know what camphor oil really is . All I know is I 'm disappointed .	0

A box arrived with 30 packets of a reddish / pinkish powder . This powder is ludicrously listed for 1 .22 per tiny packet . That may be a blessing in disguise because the price might thankfully deter someone from purchasing and ingesting this horrible product . I cut the top off of one of the powder packets and poured the contents into a one pint bottle of water per the instructions . I shook the bottle vigorously but could not get all of the powder to dissolve . A lump about half the size of a lima bean refused all attempts at being dissolved . Even when I finished drinking this unpleasant concoction and shook the lump out of the bottle it was difficult to force it to lose its lump personna and actually change into a part somewhat powdery state and partly a thick gunk . Drinking the entire pint of this hogwash was quite a challenge . This is some really bad stuff .After several hours I hoped that the strength of the terrible aftertaste would diminish . But , no such luck . I decided to set aside the taste issue and concentrate on the other listed benefits one of which is alleged to be an energy boost . No such boost came anywhere in the vicinity . Another is that is quenches your thirst . Well , it affected my thirst all right but the term I would use is not quench and it is better left unsaid . There are other benefits listed but they are just poppycock . In fairness , I do have to give credit for one attribute . The calorie count is listed as 10 and if that is actually true it is a plus and actually the only plus I can identify . This product is not a winner .	0

I bought these tights to replace a pair I bought from another Amazon seller who stole their stock pics off of Taobao and edited the shop name watermark out which were just way too small , almost child 's size .These tights , however , are totally awesome . They fit without stretching the bones out , and the knee joints place correctly over my actual knees a point that bothered me about the other pair the knee joint being at about my upper shin . . They took a while to get here once they shipped , but they 're definitely worth the wait .One more thing I thought was cute the first pair I ordered the too small pair just came in a plastic bag in an envelope shipped . These tights came in a packaging similar to if you would have bought them in a store cardboard rectangle folded up in them . placed in neat packaging wrapped in plastic . These tights came in Japanese packaging with a little card depicting a cute animestyle lolita that says 34We are shipping from China which takes longer time and higher fees than local sellers ! 34 .Definitely buy these tights , they 're an awesome accessory .	1

This is a fairly nice case . Unfortunately it only lasted about 3 months until the little tabs the hold the front cover on broke off . I 'm not sure how I 'm supposed to give it more than one star since it did n't last long enough to be any better than the 5 cases you can get here . Sadly I think that the biggest weakness of all of the cases for the phones that slide open to reveal the keyboard is that they are two piece and I ca n't see a way to make them more durable . Seems like it would be better to just avoid phones with slide out keyboards .I do n't see a point in asking for my money back since it 's just a phone case and the hassle of sending it back is n't worth it . I just wo n't buy another case from Seidio since they only sell highpriced cases .	0

I took my car in to get a tytod replaced then I was told my car would n't stay running . It ran and started up just fine before I took it in . Whatever they screwed up , they wo n't admit to it and so now I 'm stuck with a car that wo n't run . I will never do business with uftring again . I have bought all my cars through them and they just lost me as a customer .	0

I was really displeased when I pulled on the first pair and they did n't did n't fit all the way up to my knees I am only 5'4 tall . Then about two blocks after getting off the transit , I felt the sock around my ankles . So I guess if you are really short and want to fold these down , you might like them , but as far as knee socks go , I have definitely had better .	0

Recieved this case today . It 's fantastic ! fits the phone perfectly and has the volume rocker protected as well , you have to however press a bit harder on the volume buttons but that s not a big issue . I just wish they had covered the power button but for some reason they just have a cut out for it only . other than that matte case does nt leave any fingerprints / smudges on it and feels really sturdy eventhough it is rubber . I was chosing between this and Otterbox commuter case but Otterbox is twice more expensive and Diztronic looks really clean and neat on the device and yet preserves the thin profile of the phone . 5 stars !	1

It seems like every time I get a new external battery pack to use and review , I keep thinking things ca n't get much better . Then they get better . I got the chance to try out the OXA 30000mAh Metal Box S4 High Capacity External Battery Pack , and I 'm pretty impressed . There 's a few things that make it a bit difficult to use at first , but the positives far outweigh the negatives .First off , I was only expecting a biggerthanusual USB charger for my iDevices . Therefore , I was more than a bit surprised when I opened it to find that it 's a fullon charger / power supply for pretty much ANY device . It has 5V , 12V , 16V , and 19V output , so I can charge my iPhone , iPad , AND my fullsized laptop . The nonUSB cord has 8 different adapter tips , so it 'll handle a variety of power configurations . There 's definitely more 34bulk34 and weight to this unit , since it has a fullsized power plug for input , the shorter output cord , the adapter tips , and the unit itself . On the plus side , the tips have a rubber holder to keep them together , and the whole package fits into a mesh bag that OXA provides .In terms of longevity in charging , it feels like this lasts forever . I charged my iPhone five or six times using the OXA as the main charger , and it was sitting somewhere between the 50 to 75 charge remaining . This could be a power unit that would cover me for at least a week and possibly two without access to any external power . I also noticed at least in my perception that the OXA charged my iPhone faster than most other battery packs .Once I found out that this would work with my laptop , I had to try that out . I had n't used my laptop in quite a while , so it was down to 3 . In 30 minutes , the battery pack had taken it back up 25 before Windows decided it needed to restart my computer a few times . The OXA had dropped down in the 25 range , but I had n't recharged it to max power before I tried this experiment . Still , I was impressed that I could charge it at all , as I 've never had an external battery pack for the laptop . I have n't tested it yet , but I 'm curious as to how well it might work if I plug the battery into an outlet and then plug the laptop into the battery . If that configuration replaces my laptop charger , it 's a major bonus .The only real problem I had with the unit is the documentation . It 's sparse to begin with which is n't all that bad , but it 's definitely written in Englishasasecondlanguage . That would n't even bother me all that much , except that there 's a sequence of buttonpress steps to turn the unit on , off , and to change the power output . Spending just a bit more to get a native English speaker to write the documentation would go a long way towards making this a flawless product . I 'd also recommend you KEEP the directions in the pouch unless you get really comfortable with the buttonpress sequences .The OXA 30000mAh S4 wo n't be the battery pack that I take on every trip , as I wo n't likely need all that power and flexibility . But if I need to take my laptop or if I 'm going to be somewhere without power , this is a handsdown nobrainer .DisclosureObtained From ManufacturerPayment Free	1

If you are like me , you run out of cell phone power midway through the day . This gives you a full charge in less than an hour . Here 's how it works First , you charge the Anker Astro . Then , when you phone is drained , you plug the Astro into your phone and it gives you a charge . After you phone is charged , you no longer have to keep the Astro connected .My only complaint This device comes with a tiny adapter that allows you to charge your phone . The Astro comes with a mesh carrying case that is flimsy and easy to open mine opened on day 1 and continued henceforth . You have to keep track of that pesky adapter , which means you 'll likely need a better case .	1

I brought my vehicle in because I noticed a whining noise coming from my rear differential . Upon closer inspection I discovered a slight leak from one of the axle seals . When I recieved my car back the leak was gone but the noise had worsened . Also , an issue I had brought my car in for a few weeks before has not improved engine shaking during idle . I did n't dare bring my car back because during service I was recommended a ' fuel injection cleaning ' which totalled 400 . 00 . After inquiring with the dealer I purchased the car from I was told this service had been completed only a month ago purchased on June 7 .	0

This is one of the best dealership among others including other auto brands . For the last 6 years we are working with Jeff Brooks and he became our friend . Additional thanks to our last financial manager Mr . Silva for the fast and smooth purchase process .	1
Customer service during and after sale was horrible . I understand the salesman is there to make money however , as soon as he knew I was purchasing the vehicle he went and got a new customer . His manager , David , came to my wife and I and informed us that we would be out the door by 3 pm . We did n't end up leaving the store until 6 pm . When the salesman , Jason , brought the vehicle up we asked him to take our old plates off of the car so we can have them . At first he informed us that we were n't allowed to have them , he then went and asked someone who told him we could have them . After that he was only able to get our rear plate off and then asked if we had the tools to take the front plate off . We still do n't have the license plate or the plate cover that they had on our old car . The only positive part of the entire experience was the finance guy . Not sure of his name but he was upfront with us and very nice . Not sure if I 'm the only person that experienced bad customer service from this dealership but I will be sure not to recommend any of my friends to this dealership . I know I am only one customer and they already got my money but word of mouth goes a long way when it involves spending a lot of money for a new vehicle .	0
This device does n't work at all .I read the directions and have tried it on several occasions .The last time I tried I drank two ounces of whiskey and waited 20minutes as directed and it read 0 .00 . Then I drank 3 more ounces of whiskey and waited another 20minutes really buzzing at this point and it read 0 .00 again . Finally , I took some listerine and gargled with it for about 30seconds , spit it out and immediately used the device . This time it read that I had alcohol in my system , so it works in theory but it 's certainly not accurate .It would have been crazy to drive as much whiskey as I had drank but it still read 0 .00 . You should not depend upon this device at all . I would n't buy it again .	0

Tried 2 pairs with this shoe , we thought the 13 .5 was too short in laces which is why they would untie multiple times a day that by the end of the day when i picked up my daughter her laces were untied and she left them because she was tired of tying them . Ordered the 1 and the same thing . RIDICULOUS ! I refuse to buy shoes and then spend more money on new laces . Also , they collect dirt very easily , my daughter came home the 2nd day and she looked like pig pen . She has had white shoes before and never looked like this .	0

This is my second review on the Mozaik plates . While we are still using them , I can now report that they are not dishwasher safe and I am not about to wash dishes by hand . The silver decoration came off after one wash . In addition , I was not aware of the price of these dishes when I first reviewed them . They are not worth the price . You would be better off , particularly during these times , to head to Walmart and buy dishes that were designed for long term use . . .at the same price .	0

They fit perfectly but you have to keep in mind that I have no hips and a very small to non existent rear .

This probiotic has only 1 billion organisims which is really nothing in the probiotic world . Most people need at least 25 billion and that is assuming that they are still alive better brands need refrigerating to preserve the most amount of organisims . Also it contains milk I am assuming this is the source of the organisims which is not organic and that is a whole other issue .The added ingredients are also so unnecessary in a probiotic . There is no way I would take this stuff . . .it definitely will not be as beneficial as other brands . . .such as Udo 's or Jarrow . . . .which contain 42 BILLION ORGANISIMS . The Super 8 also contains several different strains and is same price or cheaper in the store .	0

Kind of like a spoonful of local sugar for the weight conscious . Straightforward and accurate .

This seems like a nice little case but the fit is a bit questionable . It states that it is for the S4 and it does go on but it does n't fit well . The power button is not lined up perfectly with the power button on the phone . However after starting to write this I decided to fight a little more with the case and the power button lines up now . The corners are nicely padded and obviously the most logical place for damage to occur . The back is nonskid and provides a good grip got on the desk , dashboard or hand . Do n't be afraid to play with it to get it to fit correctly . I almost gave up and am glad I did n't . Now I am happy with it .	1

the option of ordering online was great . the convenience fee was not . the costs to cover this website pressumably should come from the theatres . ticket price is high enough . in addition the theatres make out on the tv commercials that one attends a movie to get away from . i find that revolting . this was one reason i stopped attending the movie theatre 10 years ago , in addtion to a few other annoying social factions . this was the 3rd or fourth movie that i have attended in that time frame and although the movie was outstanding , i most likely will resort to rentals and or netflix for future viewing . paying those ticket prices , the public should enjoy some privileges of no add on fees and commercials . with that , i might be able to tolerate , inflated refreshment prices , perfume cologne laden people , cell phones and otherwise just plain rude and socially ignorant individuals who require filmed instructions on how to conduct themselves in public . thank you , i feel better	0

when i submitted a review , i thought i 'd be given an opportunity to provide an alias . instead , it used the first part of my email address as the submitter name . i feel very uncomforable about this . when a person writes a review , it should be impossible for that person to be contacted by outside people for the sake of privacy . in my case , after a few tries a person might be able to access my personal email . this is not good , in my opinion .	0

My C180 AMG Sport with only 16 , 000 miles on the clock sprang a coolant leak . Rang Mercedes Shrewsbury on 03 / 05 / 2017 and was informed they could not attend to it for a week it would then have to be diagnosed it was a faulty waterpump They then took another 3 days to get a new pump . My vehicle would have been off the road for 2 weeks . This is a disgraceful appalling service from a leading manufacturer . Written complaints to both Mercedes Shrewsbury Germany have gone unanswered . Thank goodness a nonfranchise garage fixed the problem in 4 days including the 3 days waiting on Mercedes for supply of a new pump . Happy to recommend if contacted .

Original purchase 30DEC2014 , previous review was removed from Google . I went to look at Nissan Pathfinders . My only two MustHaves was 3rd row seating and streaming Bluetooth audio . Initially looked at the S model , tried to connect phone and no audio . Salesman says the SV model comes standard with streaming audio . Seemed like a straight forward guy , I did n't check it during the test drive and bought the SUV . My wife tried to configure it a few days later and it was giving the same indications as the S Model did . I called , salesman says no big deal , you can get a Bluetooth adapter at Best Buy . I was furious , and I got a customer service survey around the same time . I blasted him in the survey for his lies and general dissatisfaction . A few days later he calls and asks for my Commands Phone number Knowing I am Military , says he is going to call and speak to my Commanding Officer about my behavior and attitude on the survey . I contacted the GM about not only this harassment but the displeasure with the vehicle and overall the entire experience At that time the same GM ran AutoNation Ford and Nissan . I got a Sorry via email , I did n't warrant a return of any of my phone calls . The GM did n't address the displeasure with the SUV or car buying process . Based on the GM 's response or lack there of , I chalked it up as a lessons learned and moved on . June 2017Looking at cars again , I requested a price quote via True Car . One of the quotes was from AutoNation . I did n't think much of it but I was curious to see if the salesman still worked at AutoNation Nissan . The guy is promoted now to a management position . I was going to update my previous review with the promotion news but I realized it has been deleted / removed . Worst customer service from the salesman to the GM . I will never purchase a vehicle or use any service from an AutoNation dealership after the purchase of the Pathfinder .	0
This guy is just about as rude as a person could possibly be . The mechanics in the service department are UNDERSKILLED and / or UNDERTRAINED . No place should be able to service a MercedesBenz better than The Official MercedesBenz Dealership . Unfortunately that is not true of this particular service center where the technician actually caused more problems to my vehicle than it had before I brought it there . This Service Manager , Tim Sauter , pretty much told me that he did n't care using other words . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TAKING YOUR VEHICLE TO MERCEDESBENZ OF OWINGS MILLS FOR ANY TYPE OF SERVICE NEEDED . People in positions of authority should have better customer relation skills and should have knowledge of cars , in this particular case . He does not ! !	0

best everI worked with Chris Moss . I have purchased many new cars and I have to say this was the best experience by far . Chris was knowledgeable , courteous and the main reason I came in . I was wondering around after the dealership closed and as Chris was leaving for the day he saw me in the parking lot . He stopped and introduced himself and we connected the next day . I travel for business and he was very patient with my slow response but at the same time made sure I did n't just walk away . I happened to be in town one day and stopped in unannounced to the dealership . Chris was not in but Bill could n't have been more helpful . He took me out on a test drive and Chris followed up with me when he came in . Total team work ! Ryan also got involved in the effort to find the right car . Overall a great experience . Chis is a great front man for the dealership .	1

It was extremely disappointing to order this sports bra in a 36 J I am really solid 36 KK and I sized down for extra support only for it arrive and be a Double G . I noticed they have changed the way this product is listed since I ordered .I am sure it 's great for gals in that larger range to an H or so , but if you actually need a larger cup size , meaning , you 've reached the middle of the alphabet and you 're ordering online because you ca n't just walk into a department or specialty store and buy a sports bra , pass on this one .	0
I just do n't get the sizing ! I purchased my normal size of pants I always wear the same size ! Tried them on , I pretty much had to jiggle my way into them . They buttoned fine , but the zipper just would NOT go up ! I was determined , and ended up with a giant blister on my finger . I finally gave up and exchanged them for the next size up . By the way , Amazon returns are AMAZING ! They ship your replacement item BEFORE they get the exchanged one ! AWESOME ! ! ! Hopefully the larger size works better . It did take a big hit to my ego , as I 've been losing weight and going a size up kind of blows REVIEW UPDATEOkay , I 've had it . I bought the next size up , AND THEY WERE SMALLER THAN THE SIZE I RETURNED ! ! ! ! ! !	0
These are easy to replace and use to fix a broken phone screen . Just always watch he ribbons , if u bend it under you have ruined the whole unit !	1
These were HUGE and nowhere near the size they were labeled to be . The loop on one of the straps broke during the first washing . Sadly disappointing at best .	0
I needed to clean the stainless steel thermal pot on my Bunn drip coffee maker . Sadly , this product is n't able to even touch the staining coffee oils enough to soften them so I can brush the pot clean . Heck , even a stainless scrubby wo n't even remove the oil stain in my pot ! If you clean your pot at least twice a week , or more often , this product might work Ok but if you seldom clean your pot do n't waste your money on this product 'cause it 's not up to deep severe coffee pot cleaning .This product is for something besides coffee pot cleaning since it does n't do that very well .	0

i just had one of the worst online purchase experiences in 30 15 years . i tried to redeem a trialpay ticket and had nothing but trouble . i finaly backed out of the purchase sequence in the hope that my credit card would not be charged as i received no place to print a ticket . the pages for trialpay were no in html format but in ascii plain text . there were no buttons shown for navigation . if you are interested i have a select all copy of the page i could send if you wanted it . in any case i do not plan to ever attempt to use any trialpay programs in the future .	0

It was a bit difficult to find a test which compared the three top D batteries with each other . The Amazon reviews were great but I always look for corroborating evidence . Battery Savers . . . makes the following statement on their website concerning D batteriesRayovac batteries last as long as Duracell Coppertop and Energizer Max based on official ANSI performance testing .ANSI stands for American National Standards Institute , a respected testing agency . Comparing the reviewer ratings and costs on Amazon today 2 / 5 / 14 yields the following informationRayovac 4 .4 stars 12 for 12 .00Duracell 4 .1 stars 10 for 14 .96Energizer 4 .7 stars 10 for 14 .99All currently come with free shipping . At an approximately 50 discount to the other batteries 1 .00 each vs . 1 .50 for the other two , the Rayovacs seem pretty costeffective to me .	1

My wife and I came to independence mazda , which was and hour away from us , on our first free weekend in 2 months . We were looking to trade in my wife 's 2013 Honda civic , which is in awesome condition and only has 50k miles on it . We were also looking to get another vehicle at or below 10k , that was a bit bigger , so that she could have more room , and lower monthly payments . My wife told them this on the phone before we came , and we were told to come see a 2013 ford escape , with a little over 60k miles , for 10k and some change . We finally get to their dealership , and sit down with a salesman , going over application details for about and hour and a half . Then , to our surprise someone else is outside test driving the vehicle we had called about and were there for . These people had arrived almost an hour after us , we saw them arrive . I mentioned how unprofessional this was to the sales man , who simply says , hey , first come first serve and I replied that we had been there first , but he was taking forever ! My wife and I finally get to look at the vehicle , and find that it has numerous deep , wide scratches and dents all over it , but the salesman told us that it had not been in a wreck . This damage was extremely noticeable , yet photos of the vehicle on their website were careful to not show them . The extent of the damage leads me to believe it was more than wear and tear and that this salesman was lying to us . Still , we test drove the vehicle . Upon finishing the test drive , we learn that the previous drivers just purchased the vehicle . This still rubbed me the wrong way , but after seeing the damage to the vehicle , I was n't inclined to purchase it anyway , so I was n't too upset . The salesman tells us that they have another escape , in a more luxurious trim package , for only 1k more , or 11000 . It was a nice looking vehicle , leather interior , and nice audio and interface . We test drive the suv , and come back , eager to make the purchase . This is where things get bad . My wife looks up the vehicle online , and sees the price online is 19000 , and asks the man , if they are really going to discount this vehicle to 11000 ? He replies yes , that it 's a good sale . We get to the desk , and he brings out a piece of paper , showing them giving us 7000 for our trade in which is probably the worst possible trade in deal we could get . We had been checking on what we could get beforehand , and we were expecting 1500 more at least . On top of this , the purchase price that was listed on this agreement , not the out the door price , was over 15000 . I point out that the saleman had told us that the price would be around 11000 , not over 15000 . The salesman tells me at first that he never said that , then later admits to it but claims that he said it should be not that it definitely was . On top of this , the salesman was repeatedly rude to us , and gave us alot of attitude when we asked questions that caught him in lies . At this point , my wife and I were extremely angry , and told them that price was not acceptable , and that the trade in was unacceptable . Then the manager comes over and tries to convince us that the reason the price was higher was due to a bunch of fine print , and alot of garbage I 'm too frustrated about right now to go into detail about . They might have scammed us if we had been first time car buyers , because we continued to catch them in lie after lie as they tried to explain why the trade in was so low , and why the vehicle was so expensive . In the end , we left , and notified them we will never do business with them , and we would tell as many people as possible of their dishonest tactics . Do not go here . These people , from the sales level all the way up to the management have no problem lying to customers , and will try to sneak a few extra thousand dollars here and there into your purchase price . Look elsewhere for your vehicle needs . We wasted our entire afternoon at this place and it ruined our night . I 'm only glad that we only wasted time , and not our money at this place .	0

I 'm still in search of the Stacker of the olden days which had ephedra . This is n't it . The directions said to take 1 pill . I took 4 , plus drank a cup of coffee , and also drank a can of diet Red Bull . I 'm still hungry and I might even take a nap .I read online that non drowsy allergy meds you can buy over the counter with pseudophedrine might work , so I 'll just try that next . These diet pills are useless . Also , if you try the allergy pills , I read you should n't go higher than 60 mg . Keep in mind most pills are something like 10 mg at a time .There 's just nothing out there . Rx meds are n't any good , even made me feel like my heart would explode Phentermine .On behalf of everyone that misses ephedra , I dedicate this to the FDA .I . .	0
I was always a Scott Tissue user , until lately . Scott has made their rolls smaller and the paper isso thin as to be useless . I really love the luxury of having a Pack of 18 rolls tucked away for futureuse . This is the way to go , in my opinion .

I received a phone call informing me about an airbag recall on my vehicle from this dealership and was told the parts are available and if we would like to schedule .

your website is still advertising the buy one get one visa signature special . however , when i contacted an online chat agent with a question , he was curt in his response that the offer was no longer valid on this site . i was really disappointed in the quality of service i received via the online chat representative , and that the offer which is still clearly posted , will not be honored . the convenience fee was also annoying . especially since it would have been covered under the visa offer .	0

I originally ordered one of the noname brands that are similar to this one from Amazon and thought it was cheap feeling and looking so I sent it back . I then ordered for 100 bucks the one directly from mophie . . . They actually are very similar . . Both felt cheap the only difference is that the mophie 's buttons rattle when moving the phone around . . . Poor quality and the mophie 's going back too . I have now ordered the Seidio extended battery back and extended battery active case as well as a hyperion 4200mah battery . Total will be about 75 bucks and get about the same amount of battery life as mophie PLUS a good protecting case .	0

Before judging this product by other reviewers , please keep in mind that every wrist injury is different and will have different results . I usually do n't do a follow up review , but this device has had such a major impact on my life . This review consists of several over the past 5 years for those of you that are serious about buying this remarkable product .OLD REVIEWltltltltltltThe concept is simple . Produce pressure in painful area to relieve pain and stabilize the area . It 's stems from the instinctual urge to hold whatever is injured . Although cheap bandages will alleviate pain , they themselves cause their own problems reduced blood flow and range of motion . Talk to any doctor and they will tell you that 's what not to do .I was a little skeptical at first to be honest . The wrist widget seemed a little pricey for me back when it was 50 , and really did n't understand the whole concept . This is not an elastic band ! It has two separate straps of which you can increase or decrease pressure as desired . It is much more comfortable than those cheap sport braces . Plus , with the minimal surface area , loss of blood flow is kept to a minimum , even with greatest of pressures .During my wrist evaluation I was only able to push down 52 LBS without feeling pain in the ulnar part of my wrist . This stems from an old wrist injury slip while I was active duty using the perfect pushup too fast . The VA hospital kept lying to me and saying it was carpal tunnel / tendinitis , and it was n't until I spoke with Wendy Medeiros , OTR , CHT the inventor and hand / wrist specialist with over 15 years experience that I had any hope at all .I WENT FROM FEELING PAIN PUSHING DOWN 52 LBS TO NO PAIN AT 85 LBS ! In response to the person that claimed this item was cheap . I had a chance to examine various models over the years , and they have definitely gotten from good to great as Wendy takes suggestions from her clients and continues to improve her already outstanding product like shorter straps accommodating those of us with small wrists . However , at the end of the day , it is still just a wrist brace . The same quality that you would find with the most expensive wrist brace on the market like Futuro a very good brand . Like anything Velcro , this quality product does have a limited shelf life .ltltltltltltOVER ONE YEAR LATERAlright , well here I am still stuck with VA insurance , and am hoping I can get this wrist taken care of once and for all soon . Paid full price for an MRI , and although it shows fluid buildup in my ulnar wrist area , no visible broken cartilage tear can be seen with both my MRI and the many XRays that have been takenwhich is making this surgery hard to obtain . I still use this device daily , and only take it off to shower / wash the widget . I can usually get 4ish months of continuous use 24 / 7 out of these widgets before having to finally throw them out when the Velcro ceases to function properly .Although this device has not cured my condition , it has almost completely hidden the symptoms during use . Only side effect is the occasional rash that occurs from my extreme use which a little A D cream takes care of . If I take off the widget for more than a couple hours , full symptoms return .ltltltltltltlt2 / 11 / 2014 6 / 27 / 2014Alright , so a lot has happened since my last review . Finally met a orthopedic surgeon that was able to go in with a scope and repair the torn cartilage that they found . Things went well for a couple of years afterwards , but I again slipped my wrist tossing a small piece of tree that I chopped up with my chainsaw , and here I am again thanking Wendy for this remarkable product that gets me through the day until I can afford another pricey risky operation and time off .I use this product now for more wrist stability purposes than just pain relief , since the last surgery has made my wrist even more prone to slipping .I hear rumors inside my physical therapy office of a new plasma injection therapy that has yet to be paid by insurance companies that draws your own natural stem cells to old injuries and am continually hopeful that if I wait long enough , better corrective measures will come along .	1
I really like these little bowls that are also much better for the environment than using regular paper or plastic bowls . I use these bowls for a variety of things such as when I mixed hair dye , seperating ingredients I am using to cook , feeding my cats and small dog , and even to pour in a face peel for application . I feel these are really great multiuse bowls .It is important to note that a 7 ounce bowl is actually pretty small . A can of soda is 12 ounces so it really is n't something that you can use to have a meal , but you can use these bowls for a snack or many other thigns . I love them . They are pretty durable and can be thrown out after without feeling too wasteful . The only thing to be careful of is that they do hold liquids pretty well , but if you let a liquid sit in the bowl for a while it is possible that it can start to seep through . It does n't happen fast so under normal use they will be fine , but if the bowl has a little liquid in it I would n't suggest letting it sit for a day before throwing it out .	1

I 've been wearing FitFlops since they were introduced to the market about ten years ago . I have every style from Walkstars to styles embellished with gems and their winter boots . I find them to be as secure as sneakers but more comfortable .These , however are not like the others . The toe seam is sewn in a location where it rubs between the toes and the instep is much higher than the styles that I own .They look pretty but i 'll never wear them so I returned them .	0

I bought my SBM300 Shiatsu Massaging Cushion having had before the nmodel SBM200 version of the same type of cushion .Both of them had the same defect and broke in the same place after three or four months of normal use . There is a plastic vertical piece that serves as a guide of the moving mechanism which is made of a thin and cheap plastic which broke in the same place with both cushions . I disassembled the cushion to try to fix it as I live in Argentina , South America and it is impossible to send it by any means and I found this very cheap , thin plastic guide that can not possible hold the back of a normal person . I weigh 154lbs and I am 5'7'and I do nt understand how can I possibly break a piece of plastic by leaning gently as I always did , knowing about the weakness of this plastic in my previous cushion .I imagine this defect repeats itself in almost 100 of the failures of this cushion and should have been analized and replaced by a stronger plastic .Does Homedics have any type of quality control and engineering design ? I simply do nt understand this lack of capacity to fix such evident and reported defects .The cushion is all right and brings good service and action , but until it breaks . In my case my failure rate was 100 in both cushions that I bought through Amazon .	0

Product worked as advertised at first , nearly doubling the battery life , then I experienced a sharp dropoff in battery life to where I was at the same charge levels at the end of the day as with the OEM HTC battery .

A smart looking case for your smart phone . it 's easy to put on your phone so long as you pay attention and read the instructions . mine has already taken a tumble or two and no scratches on the case even . the nice part about the case is the phone now sits flush on the table and does n't sit on the camera lens and it has a lip so when you place the phone up side down the screen has some distance away from the surface still .This is a great case and it 's thin too so does n't add bulk . I recommend it .UPDATEAfter having this case for a few months the area near the camera has started to bow out and sag a little . Not a HUGE deal , but enough for it to disappoint me a bit . No stars off , but not really worth more than 15 imo .Update 2After about 6 months the frame around the case broke , but the company will not honor their warranty unless you purchased it from their website . Really ? ! ? ! down to 1 star just on the stupid warranty bull alone .	0

This was better than expected . Not difficult to put on at all if you take your time . Does not interferre with the proximity sensor , at least not that i can tell as of yet . It does cover it up but it does n't seem to matter . Feels glassy and not rubbery like some others . Take your time to get the bubbles out and it becomes hardly detectable .	1

It 's ugly and cheap looking . I mean , I guess for 4 .99 it 's okay . It 's a lot bigger than the picture makes it look , it 's in a cheap little package , and has ear rings with it too ? Not happy about it , but for 4 .99 I 'll keep it . Maybe hang it from my rear view mirror or something .	0
A bit hard to review deodorant . .but I 'll do my best . I think I prefer this brand over Degree , though I like Degree 's variety of scents better . Ca n't say I LIKE smelling like a baby 's butt , but it 's better than B .O . Twelve hours after application , it 's working . Much better than your average store bought deodorant and worth the extra buck or two . I would like to see them make this in a solid roll on , rather than this soft stuff you have to squeeze through little holes at the top , but happy with this product regardless .	1

I initially bought this gel pack because I 'd sprained my low back again and needed a large pack . I love that it retains its flexibility even at maximum coldness . The outer skin is nice and thickimportant because my last gel pack sprung a leak . My son likes to use it to keep himself cool at night he 's a hot sleeper . But what I 've been using it for most lately is to keep my laptop cool when I 'm playing Minecraft with my son . At max load , the internal thermometer can hit 80 degrees Celcius the gel pack knocks the running temp down to around 60 C . Bonus !	1

i was soooo excited to get this case . I have another case made by the same company that I absolutely love , so I was pretty confident about getting this one also . it took FOREVER to get to my house . when I got it , it was in the three pieces , like I was expecting . I put it together on my phone , and the bottom piece would n't fit . when I took a closer look , the latches on the sides did n't come close to lining up with the holes to latch it into . after ten minutes of fighting with it and trying different things , I gave up . I am SO disappointed in what I received . I opened the package less than a half hour ago and the case is in the garbage already . DO NOT BUY !	0

This was a fantastic purchase ! I have had my share of cases in the past and know what I am looking for .I want a nonobtrusive , slim case . This one fits the bill perfectly ! For those of you who are looking for a case to protect your phone from scratches , but will retain the basic shapeand feel of your phone , than look no further .This case also has a really cool feel to the back . It 's kind of a grippy matte finish that I really enjoy .It does not seem to attract lint like the 34gel34 type cases , but still provides some nonslip surface .This would probably not be the best case for someone who drops their phone habitually , or is otherwise going to really abuse it .You folks will need something a bit more substantial .I do like the 34lip34 this case provides around the edge of the phone . It keeps the screen off the surface if you chose to lay your phone screen down which I do all the time .I did not try the included screen protector . It had an almost bluish hue to it , I thought it would ruin the quality of the screen .So if you are like me and are looking for a case that will keep the finish of your phone looking new , but do n't want too much added bulk , than give this one a shot . Worst case is you can return it with Amazon 's awesome return policy .	1
Great customer service and first class treatment to me and my vehicle , highly recommended ! ! !	1
I 'm an allnatural nut . I hate putting things in my body that are n't natural . And that 's why I really loved this extract . Doctor Oz is notorious for finding the best new products before anyone else does and my mom has the uncanning ability to always tell me about them . I heard about this one and thought I 'd give it a try . I was just trying to lose about an inch or two from my waist line . I started on this supplement and about two weeks later had dropped six pounds which was exactly what I wanted . I did n't feel worn out , drowsy , or get on really ' high cycles ' of energy like I have with other weight loss pills . This one was really subtle . I did n't feel any sideeffects aside from a mild halt to my appetite which was good . I had a bit more energy and felt healthier . One month later , the weight is still off and I 'm really pleased . I love trying out allnatural products and this one has become one of my favorites . I 'd highly suggest it for anyone looking for a safe , easy way to drop a few pounds . Combined with a healthy diet and a bit of excersize it works wonders .	1

My husband and I were looking for a good car and decided to take a look at Hyundai . We honestly had no idea if we would like them , but it was worth a look . It was our lucky day when we went to Hyundai of Kennesaw and found Kevin Shakur . Kevin was great and made us feel very comfortable going thru the process . He was thorough , informative , patient with all our questions , listened to us and found us exactly the car we wanted . The very last thing we expected was to feel like we could trust any car salesman , but Kevin proved us wrong . Not one time did we feel any high pressure from Kevin . He made us feel like he had our best interest in mind and wanted us to get a great car and to feel comfortable with our purchase . We are very happy with our Tucson . We also found out that Hyundai 's are really good cars . Friends and family were very impressed and had nothing but good things to say about our purchase . We highly recommend Kevin Shakur to anyone who wants a very knowledgeable and great guy to help them with the purchase of a new or used Hyundai . We have no doubt he will do the best job possible to get you exactly the car you want . Every single person we met at Hyundai of Kennesaw was nice , friendly and extremely helpful . Thanks again Kevin . It was a pleasure working with you and all the people that we worked with at the dealership .	1
Bought a car from these guys and they were amazing including Kevin , dave and Andre . They were professional and courteous . They got my car ready just in time and the paperwork was done accurately ! ! Will do business with them again	1
I bought this for my husband after his rotary electric razor failed after many years . Going from a 30 to a 170 razor raises your expectations however , he says this razor shaves no differently from the cheaper one AND it requires the continual purchase of cleaning solution . In addition , shortly after receiving it the base unit would get stuck in cleaning mode and would run all night . Its bad enough waiting 1 / 2 hour for the cleaning process to complete but all night ? We 're not performing surgery with this razor . There 's no need for cleaning solution after every use . The other razor worked just as well just shaking it out , and did n't suck electricity 24 / 7 . Amazon wo nt let you send it back so we had to mail it , at our cost , to the manufacturer for a refund . Have not received it yet .	0

These are amazing . Sound quality is excellent . BT reception is a good as I would expect , as I can walk around my house and never loose a connection . I would prefer over the ear , but the onear comfort of these is good .	1
I really like how its so easy to just drop and charge without worrying about it overcharging or losing its charge . The travel unit is compact and easily fits into a pocket or purse for travel . I was concerned about the cover being slippery to hold but it is not . the rubber sides actually make it easy to grip and carry . I have dropped it by mistake and watched it bounce and land on its back . Its a great charger and can be adapted for use in the car or at home . It was a good value , price wise .	1

11 10 2013 i had two recent problems with fandango , at two different theaters . i have used fandango for several years , but yesterday and today , i could not print my tickets . the option was not offered . the confirmation told me to go to theater with credit card i purchased the tickets and get the tickets at the theater . i could not process at the theater kiosk and had to go to the ticket booth . i still paid fandango for services i did n't receive . at this point , fandango really does n't have any service to offer and still collects their fee . i would like my money returned , as well as an explanation . i will not use fandango until i am satisfied with both a refund and and explanation . b . thompson	0
We purchased our car MINI Countryman out of lease from a Financial Service Co . used by BMW financial . SCHOMP Mini processed all the paperwork for us and made sure everything was done correctly . Merrie Thomson was the individual we worked with at Schomp and she was excellent . She understood what needed to be done and Made it Happen . She also spent additional time researching warranty information for our car and provided many options . Schomp Mini did a great job and we will be happy to use them in the future for our motoring needs . Terry and Kenya Nolte , Denver Co	1

Like everyone else said , it clogs constantly and the toothpaste pops out of the top of the dispenser . It 's a great idea , but the execution is lacking . I wish there were more options but this is the only one I could find . We 're throwing ours out and wo n't be purchasing another .	0
I love these shoes , and I was happy with how cute they looked when I took them out of the package . In the picture it looks more like suede but the shoes have more shiny of a look . They fit perfectly ! I wear a 6 .57 and I ordered a 7 just in case and I think they fit just right on my feet . I like how the sole feels sturdy . I will have to test them out now for wear but as of right now I love them	1
This was way to small for an average adult head . . . Which it was pictured on . A child , ADORABLE . But mine broke into about 6 pieces the first time I tried to wear it .	0
BATTERY KEPT DRAINING AFTER SUCH A SHORT TIME . SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THE LAZA STICKER OFF AND SEE IF MAYBE THE BATTERY I BOUGHT WAS MADE CHEAPLY . TURNS OUT THE STICKER SAYS 1730Mah ONCE YOU REMOVE THE STICKER YOU CLEARLY SEE THAT THE BATTERY ORIGINALLY WAS MADE ON 1000MaH . MAYBE THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR A BATTERY THAT IS GARBAGE . FALSE ADVERTISEMENT WILL NOT BUY AGAIN .	0

wasted my timeVery poor experience . Called in on a Sunday to make sure the 7 series I was interested in was available . I was told by Michael that it was . I told him that I would be there in an hour to test drive . He said no problem and that he will have it waiting out front for me . Upon arrival I was informed that someone else was currently test driving the car . Waited around 20 min to find out that the car is being sold to that person . The manager called it a slight bump . That 's not how it felt to me . I drove an hour for nothing . I assumed that the car was being held for me . Not the case . I guess all this dealership cares about is making a sale . To top it off he said I could wait some more to see if the deal actually goes through . As if my time was n't already being wasted enough . Completely unprofessional .	0

I did not expect this item to be as beautiful as it is . They are exactly as pictured but even more lovely in person . My husband lucked out .

I failed to read the review , my fault .Battery is not the one pictured , no Near Field Communication imprint on the battery .The GS2 requires NFC batteries for proper communication with the phone .Not worth to have as a backup as it might cause damage to the phone .This is not an ORIGINAL SAMSUNG PRODUCT ! Verified by calling Samsung .All Samsung Galaxy S2 batteries were manufactured with NFC chips built in .This battery does not have the required NFC .Do yourself a favor and spend more on original equipmentyes it 's considerably more expensive on Samsung 's website 40 .00 . But original is original and is backed by Samsung in the event something should go wrong because of the battery installed .Pain in the rear to have to send it back , but Amazon did provide a paid shipping label and will provide a complete refund .Here is the kicker . . .I called my service provider after almost ordering the 40 battery on Samsung 's site , and told them that my original battery was n't holding charge the way it used to . They were happy to send me a replacement battery free of charge . No questions asked ! Ca n't speak for all providers , but my provider mentioned that even if the phone was past warranty period , they would still replace the battery free of charge . NICE ! !	0
Buying these headphones was a terrible mistake . The sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing . I bought these to use with my Palm Pre . I do n't know if the problem is Pre related , the Pre 's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies , or if these are just lousy headphones . Either way the combination of the Pre and these headphones is not a good one , Palm Pre owners should avoid these . I have a cheap pair of wired headphones that have an order of magnitude better sound when used with my Pre .	0

i have always really liked this site and love printing out my ticket from home . i do n't really like the changes you have made , if its not broke , do n't fix it . it now takes me more clicks to get to my theaters i really with you could display the auditorium the movie is playing in before you print the ticket , as some auditoriums are better than others at the theatre i go to and i would choose a different time so that i could see the movie in one of the nicer auditorium .	0
i am very disappointed that your site wo n't allow the customer to select movie title and allow a search by state . i was willing to drive to another city anywhere closest to me to watch a movie , but your site failed to provide that opportunity . a person must have a city or zip . this movie viewer would appreciate that option .	0

Fits the phone like a glove . Very compact and love the strap can be used as small hand purse . too cute love it ! ! !	1
I wore these almost every time I was out running last winter . I live in PA . The temperatures were in the ranges of 40 to warmest and around 10 degrees as coldest . With the wind blowing that is . Anyways , I was out on very cold days with these pants and they were easily the warmest part of my body . For running that is great because your legs wo n't cramp up . It keeps your muscles loose . If only the rest of my body could have been as warm . I was the only one who went in the water at the beach this early summer because I could withstand the cold . Get these , they are perfect for running in cold weather .	1

I purchased this product because I was looking for a natural deodorant that would replace the Earth Science stick I had currently been using . I got this product in the Vetiver scent . The scent is a bit more manly than I would have liked , but I decided to stick with it and give it a shot . This stuff was terrible . Did not work for me at all . I am a stay at home mom and am in an air conditioned environment for most of the day . I have tried it a few times as follows8230take a shower at night . Spray the deodorant on . Go to sleep . Within a few hours into the morning , I was already noticing a not so fresh scent . As you can see , there was not much activity between the time I applied it and when it 34stops34 working . I put quotation marks on stops , because I do n't think it ever really was working . That was just my body doing it 's thing . I just purchased Crystal Deodorant Spray unscented , and am crossing my fingers that I get a better result than I did with this .	0
Customer service is abysmal . I purchased a plastic one as well as a steel model . The plastic model would not keep a charge more than one day . It took weeks for them to replace it . The steel one was DOA . I returned that weeks ago and they still have not replaced it or provided a refund . Virtually every email no customer service 800 number response was nonsense and and unrelated to my complaints . Buyer beware ! Once you purchase on of these watches , you 're on your own .	0

My heels have been mild to moderately cracked for a few years now , and I have tried a couple of creams to alleviate the unsightly nuisance . With daily buffing and applying cream , I kept them somewhat under control but I was never satisfied with the results . I saw this cream on Amazon recently and thought I 'd give it a try based on the reviews . I must say , I am amazed at the results in just a week to ten days . I actually saw progress in 23 days . I no longer buff my heels but only apply this cream at night and maybe once / week during the morning . My heels are smoother than they have been in years . No more cracks to worry about catching some fungus at the gym . Well worth the few dollars it cost .	1

i have found using fandango to be so easy and time saving . the only comment i 'd like to give is to please consider not showcasing upcoming villans as in your recent happy new year fandango email . how about focusing on the heros for a change . we really need to turn a corner toward a more peaceful culture decreasing the amount of violence in movies is a small step in that direction . thank you for your consideration .	1
I purchased a BMW X5 2014 from this dealler . The service of this dealer was 5 stars plus . I was out of state , they sent me a personal driver and picked me up from airport .

Sam and his helper was really helpful and really knowledgeable about a bmw .	1

Great product . Very compact for travel unlike some other products that are labeled for travel . Used it on a recent trip and it performed as expected .	1
I bought this to wear around in the evenings during the cooler months which around here runs from now October to April . I slip out of my bluejeans and put these on . I wear it practically every evening now . It is soft and durable . Had a pair for a year now , wash them regularly in normal wash and it is holding up fine . The fly is convenient and the two pockets are a must . After all , you need some place to stick a tissue at the very least . I am 5'10 with a 32 waist so I ordered medium and it fits good . Legs are not tight or form fitting which I would not like for casual in house wear . I can step outside for a few minutes and take out the garbage or do something and not feel like I am being too riskee ' if a neighbor sees me . Easy to put on and take off . The fabric tie for the waistband works and the ties are thick and not easily broken . It looks pretty much just like the photo . . .dark navy blue and black flannel weave . Perfect for when your house temperature is lower during colder periods but would probably feel too warm on a summer 's night when the house is warmer . I do n't wear these to bed , heck , I do n't wear anything to bed so I can not comment on comfort for sleeping . I liked the first pair so much I just ordered a second one so I can rotate them during the week .	1
I have been watching Dr Oz to see what I can do to obtain total health and he mentioned in one of his shows that every adult should take a multi vitamin and probiotic , I have been eating right and exercising and I am going to take care of myself and have total health this year .

So I am happy with this product .	1

This is one fine robe . It is .very soft and keeps you warm and toasty . Plus it has a hood which is great for taking a nap , just sit in your favorite chair lean back and pull the hood over your head and it 's lights out . It is sized generously , better too big than not enough . It is best used in cold or a cool environment . If the temperature gets over 70 degrees I have to take it off . Just get too hot . That is n't a negative , there is no such thing as a robe for all environments . .	1
Super nice owner and staff . Way more integrity than any other motorcycle dealer that I 've been to . Supports the riding community . Worth the trip !	1
Too expensive for what you get . Use barbecue lighter fluid instead . It is cheaper and works just as well . You may also want to try naphtha that can be purchased at your local home improvement store for a few dollars a quart . Oh yeah , naphtha is also called cigarette lighter fluid , the kind used in Zippo lighters . Yes , you can use the home improvement store naphtha in your Zippo , exact same chemical .	0

So I used this for 3 days . Had minimal sensitivity . I had used Crest white Strips in the past different version , and knew what to expect . I do not know it there 's something special in this , or extra concentrated or what , but the whole inside of my mouth broke out and was swollen . I felt like I had chemical burns in my mouth . . .Crest offers a one time cash back offer , so I mailed that in .I did look around for other reviews or anything people experienced like that . All I found were sensitivity problems .On the plus side , my teeth were a bit whiter . . .	0

Following advise of others , I ordered wider than normal and I like how they feel ! I 'm not sure if less wide would have been better or worse , but I am very happy .

I was asked to buy New Balance by my diabetic doctor because they are well designed , supportive and non abrasive to the feet ie no blisters , etc .	1

Rude customer service . I called asking about purchasing an m2 and the sales person told me he would call me back , never called me back . So I decided to stop by the showroom and check . As soon as I walked In , the gentleman who spoke with me was very uninterested in my business and told me they did n't have any m2 . He then walked over to his desk gave me his business card and walked me to the door . He then opened it and told call me In two days . Thanks made my car buying decision easier , I 'll go for a Mercedes benz instead .	0

hi , i wrote to you previously about a situation where we were unable to get senior discounts to the hobbit on the fandango website . when we got to the alamo winchester movie we saw that we could have saved 6 by buying the tickets there . ( plus the small cost of using fandngo ) they would not give us the 6 savings since we used your firm . is there anyway to get a 6 refund or credit from your firm ? it was the first time we used fandango . please respond . . thanks joan zuckerman	0

In 20 years in the automotive industry I have NEVER seen a service department more poorly run then this one . I was called you people by a service advisor . When I told the assistant manager about it he defended the employee . I was never once contacted by the actual MANAGER OF SERVICE only a assistant . They held my vehicle there for a week and a half and did n't return any of my phone calls . I have never been so disrespected and disgusted by a business in my entire life . Dealerships like this give our whole industry a bad name . DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE THERE ! ! ! !	0

As we simply seem to not be able to leave the house without the phone these days , this case allows you to add your ID , some other cards and some cash if you desire to the phone cover and have not need to carry a wallet or other bag / purse .As the photo on the product shows , there are several ways you can use the cover as a stand to watch a video or pictures or view your emails , another great feature .The Cover also comes in many different color choices so it makes sense to buy several covers of different colors for your choice of outfit , my wife does this with her phone , as she likes to match .I definitely will buy this case again , as I gave mine to my daughter for her S4 yesterday , she is going to get a couple for her outfit choices as well .Buy it , you will not be let down .	1

This cover is unbelievably a piece of s ! It is not leather . It does not fit my phone . I have purchase many phone covers on Amazon and I have always been happy with them . I am not happy with this cover .	0
Great little case . Sleek and sturdy . Provides protection without taking away from the design of the phone . Slides in and out of pockets easily as well . Good buy !	1

I had service done on my 911 turbo and had a very poor experience . The loaner was dirty inside and out , they had to order the transmission filter and it ended up taking a week . The interior door panel had damage when I picked the car up . Called the service manager and never got a call back . NOT impressed .	0
Braman sent me a notice that I was entitled to free service during August . When I arrived for my appointment , Fernando told me I would have to pay since my car was still under warranty . I could get free service by waiting until Oct or Nov . It took him a while to understand my displeasure that they had taken the initiative to offer me a service that their own records could show I was not eligible for . The fact that I had made a wasted trip did not seem to be a problem for him . I asked him to please pass my concerns up the line so that Braman would stop sending out invalid invitations . The next day , I received an email gently chastising me for missing my service appointment . I called Braman to let them know I HAD showed up for the appointment . I sat on hold for a while while the clerk tried to find a supervisor to speak with me . Then I was told that Ryan would call me back . Still waiting .	0

My BP has historically been around 117 / 60 . When I bought this unit purchased from Sams Club , I suddenly averaged 130 / 80 . Talk about being concerned , especially with the good reviews for this unit . However , when I went for an annual exam my BP was 106 / 60 . I was very relieved my BP has n't been increasing as significantly as this unit implied . The nurse said that these units are notoriously bad . Luckily for me , I purchased mind from Sams and could return it after 60 days , which I did this week . Do n't waste your money !	0
a suggestion for the next revision of your website i had written with a question , how do you change the date to see show times ( and order tickets ) on days other than the current date ? i got the answer that i had to first log out of fandango , in order to first select my zip code , and then i could chose the date of the show times in which i am interested . but is n't this irrational ? is n't this an inconvenience to logged in members ? as a member , it 's convenient to just go each time to fandango directly , with my pc retaining my logged in status . why deny me and other logged in members the ability to see other dates ( e . g . , the next day 's show times ) just because we are already logged in ? i respectfully submit this suggestion that when you again redesign the website , that you allow already logged in members to chose to see other dates on which to view show times and buy tickets . thank you .	0

very irritated ! i tried for almost 20 minutes to complete my purchase because advertisements kept blocking the button ! i was very close to quitting and never using fandango again . . . i took a screenshot of the issue i was having and would like to send it to you . everytime i would see the complete purchase button and try to push it an advertisement would pop up over the button and so it would take me to a website i did n't want to visit .	0

I 'm an Oral B user of many years , have always bought replacement brushes at the local drugstore , and was completely satisfied . I purchased this 3pack of replacement heads and had one come apart in my mouth after a few weeks of normal use . The metal pin at the end of the head came completely out and the rotating head came off . Both head and metal pin were loose in my mouth , an obvious swallowing hazard . The packaging displayed here does not look like my packaging , which is very plain saying only Oral B Precision Clean , and the brush just feels cheap .I can not prove this brush to be a counterfeit yet , but I am contacting Oral B .Update Contact Oral B by telephone . Item I received is counterfeit and Oral B requested I return it to them . If your item 's packaging does not look identical to the customer supplied images , I would not use the replacement head .	0
I have a very thick beard , I tend to ruin razors fast when I shave . The ESLT42 K handled my tough beard with no problem . I also tend to get in grown hairs so I like to shave in the shower , it seems to minimize the ingrown hairs . I recommend using a shaving lotion or gel when shaving , it seems to require less return strokes and shortens the shaving time . The trimmer is virtually a shaver also , allowing for very precise styling , I have a Van Dyke . Charges very fast and holds a charge for many shaves , I get about 4 or 5 shaves per full charge . Since I use it almost exclusively in the shower there is very little clean up but it does clean up very easy . Very light weight . Will update as to the durability . Very highly recommended !	1

I was SO excited to get the dress pictured . Especially because of the princess sleeves . When I received it nearly a month after purchasing , it was absolutely nothing like the picture1 I am a size 6 . I wear a M . This fit like a L or XL . The skirt was short , but the waist was loose and the arms way too long .2 There is zero puff in the sleeves . They just hang straight down .3 There are really bright gold sequins on the collar . It was way muted down in the pic . I feel like it 's a night club collar on a frumpy dress .Please note that because this ships from China , they do n't like returns because of the shipping costs . You get a partial credit . They currently are telling me I can get a 3 credit , and give it away to someone . Unacceptable . I want at least 10 credit , and I will donate it to Goodwill . I would n't gift this to anyone in good conscious . I am awaiting their reply .	0
i think that fandango website should only display movie theaters that accepts their services . i purchased a digital gc for my husband as we attempted to get a print out of the tickets we were sadly notified that none of our theaters in town takes fandango purchases . i was really disappointed bc i made it a point to look up our theaters in jackson tn and when it was listed ii figured it was confirmed as one of the accepting theatures . well apparently i pulled it up but i did n't notice the tabs up top that listed ( all theaters ) and ( fandango theaters ) . i called customer service sunday 31st and spoke to tony who basically said that my refund had to be approve and may take up to two weeks ! ! ! ! i still have n't heard from anyone . i really felt misleaded billing information tinisha schmidt 46 greybark cove jackson , tn 38305 7416144664 confirmation 1773887258 order date december 23 , 2012 total 15 . 00	0

Bought a new and a used car ! ! I bought two cars from Jay Simon . A new BMW X3 and an Audi A5 . Jay was very knowledgeable about both cars even though it is a BMW dealership ! The customer service was amazing , everyone was extremely nice and helpful . Jay goes above and beyond all expectations , he even stayed past closing time to address all of our concerns and questions . We would definitely purchase a vehicle from Jay again , no matter his location . Definitely exceeded all expectations and deserves high praise from his peers and his management . His associate Michele was also extremely personable and helpful with making the car buying process a smooth and enjoyable event . Her knowledge and expertise in the field definitely was expressed . Her commitment to stay late and help us with the process was a welcomed change in the world of high stress car sales . Jay 's Manager was extremely helpful in assisting in giving us a more than fair pricing on two traded vehicles . His demeanor was professional and light hearted . We can not say enough about Masano BMW . From our perspective , we will continue to have a lifelong partnership with this dealership and the quality staff at this location . The no pressure and friendly staff we encountered earned our loyalty to the Tom Masano family of dealerships .	1

There are MANY technical features to like about this product 2 device connectivity , stereo audio , noise cancellation , etc .But before any of that matters , comes comfort and fit .This device ONLY fit in the right ear . I did a search on the Amazon product description , and this is not mentioned ANYWHERE ! I prefer to wear my earphone in my left ear , so this was already close to a nonstarter for me .I decided to still give it a shot though . In my right ear , I found the headset to be completely unadjustable . The angle , the depth it goes into my ear , etc . . . all do not lead to a good fit , and the headset feels lose and moving around .I've owned a BlueAnt headset for quite some time . . . and it does n't take much adjustment to allow for a good fit . But it does take some , and this device has zero .	0
I brought my car in because there was a slight oil leak . I dropped the car off and was given a courtesy car to drive while my car was being worked on . The car is still under warranty , there was no cost to me and the car was returned washed and spotless . This is the 6th brand new car I have purchased in my life , and is my favorite car ever . This is also the only time I have used the dealership for all maintenance on my car . I am so happy with the service I receive here , and I know when I am ready to buy another car , it will be another car from this dealership .	1
Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case Rev . 2 for Samsung Galaxy S5 . . .I searched high and low for a case that would be a slim fit , not be slippery ie show every finger print and did not allow the proud camera touch a surface when laying flat on a table .

I am normally a big fan of the UGGs product but this one did nt work . I bought this one for my mother for a Christmas gift but she said the soles of these slippers are too flat and gives her a leg ache . I have a pair of Ugg slippers but they are thicker soles .

This product is just wonderful ! I have to be honest though , I did n't buy it for its energizing products . Instead , I was following a series of Youtube testimonials for hair growth that attribute this bottle their many length of African American gorgeous hair growth . One of them I remember stated that at the end of the first bottle she had like 5 inch of new growth ! While I have n't experience any of the alleged growth , I have noticed that I 'm taking less napes through the day and I do have more deep sleeps through the night . This means the world for someone that like me has a hard time sleeping past two consecutive hours . I also feel full of energy through the day and more focus . I attribute this improvement in my daily routine to this product because I can tell the difference the times I 've skipped 3 days in a row .I will definitely continue drinking it I also love the taste , If I did n't mentioned that before . I will try other things for my hair growth but I will definitely be drinking this more often ! The company delivers fast and has a beyond your wildest dream and will go above and beyond to satisfy their customers . They have definitely won me as a regular customer . I 'm considering buying in bulk so that I can give my fiance to try it out .	1

Overall , absolute worst dealership experience I ve ever had . Critical issue took 6 weeks to get a license plate put on the bike in order to legally ride it . And I ended up putting it on myself . On top of 3 separate orders to get the broken mirror replaced and 4 extra trips to the dealership 1 . 5hr one way . Ill talk about the b . s . deal below . First , the bike . 7 / 31 I put a deposit down with Salesman Andre on a 2009 Yamaha FZ1 . It had a broken mirror and missing frame slider . Andre said that he could negotiate off the price to accommodate the broken and missing parts . Cool . On 8 / 5 I scheduled an appointment for 3 pm . Andre said they had the missing and broken parts in stock and would put them on for me no problem . Took 4 hours to do 15 minutes of paperwork , did nt have the parts , and ultimately did n't install them . Not cool . Turns out , they did nt negotiate the price for the missing and broken parts they added them at full price on top of the sale . The replacement mirror they ordered was not correct , took two more additional orders to get it right , and I had to return to the dealership to get it . And I had to install the mirror and frame slider myself . Sales manager Rey told me that he s not going to lose money on shipping the parts to me . Really , after I was told it would be negotiated off but I paid full price for them and had to install them myself after I was told you would do it for me ? Very not cool . The next day I noticed the temp tag they put on was not on the bike anymore . The plate and frame fell off on the way home from the dealership ! I contacted Andre immediately . He apologized and said they have another plate there and they would put it back on no problem . I returned next week to get the license plate fixed . Only to be told that Andre was not working that day and they could nt help me . They agreed to mail me a new temp tag . The replacement plate arrived and it was a plastic frame cover with the advertisement cardboard display . How the hell am I supposed to attach a plastic frame cover to my bike ? Where the hell is my temporary tag so that I can legally ride this bike I bought three weeks ago ? Straight up incompetent . Side note back to the sale . They have a little card game to get a 10 off coupon . Christian ? told me and my girlfriend this grandiose story that we can go stay in his condo in the Dominican Republic and hell have his security pick us up and drop us off for safety . I ve since run into Christian twice and he looked past me without speaking . What a clown . My temp tag that they mailed me got lost . Returned to the dealership again , got a new temp tag but I still had no way to attach it to the bike . Andre got approval from the district manager to order the correct frame plate that mounts on the motorcycle . But I had to physically return to the dealership another week later to pick it up . When Andre handed me the license plate frame he asked me , Is this the right part ? To which I replied , I do nt know , I guess Ill find out when I put it on . 6 weeks have now passed , its 9 / 16 , I got my hard plate in the mail , and spent half my Sunday installing the license plate frame on my bike . Instructions state Professional Installation Recommended . And now I know why because I had to disassemble the entire rear end of the bike , disconnect and remount the turn signals in order to install the correct license plate frame . Lastly , this would nt be as bad if I had not agreed to their extra bumper to bumper Extended Warranty and also the Maintenance Program that added over 3 , 300 to the price . They did nt negotiate what they promised , did nt install what they promised , and did nt fix these missing / broken items they promised on the initial sale deal . One more thing , their 450 Dealer Prep fee turns out to be 487 to make sure everything is sound is b . s . based on the mismatched , broken , incorrect parts and pieces that I have found , fixed and replaced myself . Based on other reviews , this seems to be a trend and now not surprising at all in hind sight . Proceed at your own risk . Cheers .	0

For all of the Nokia bashing by the media over the past few years , the 808 has been a breath of fresh air for me . The PureView tech on this device makes dedicated picture and video devices a thing of the past . . .at least when it comes to high quality point and shoot cameras . In fact , unless you absolutely need a DSLR , this phone will do it all . Sound quality is also off the charts . . .with the Rich Recording and full DOLBY capabilities inside the 808 . It also packs a super sized XENON flash for nighttime stills AND a hi powered LED for evening video flashlight .Browser The default browser is OK but lags behind the competition . Easily solved by installing Opera Mobile and / or Opera Mini . Opera Mobile is leading most benchmarks . Like the browser on the iPhone , Opera does not support flash . However , the default browser is Flash Lite capable .UI Very smooth and fluid . Belle FP1 is IMO on par with Android 2 .3 . . .in terms of the user experience .Apps Of course , you will have to settle for less apps 30 K for the 808 . That being said , 9 times out of 10 I have found a Belle version of a popular app . . .or at least a near proxy . No Kindle Reader app . Skype does not yet offer video calling via its client . . .though the device itself is fully capable .As for games . . .the dedicated GPU is a screamer . . .so it performs well . From Angry Birds , to Raging Thunder 2 , Real Golf 2011 , Fruit Ninja . . .there 's plenty to choose . However , it can not compare to the game selection offered by Apple .Battery Excellent . . .close to 2 days with average use . Also removable .Build Solid . The polycarbonate chassis feels good in the hand and exudes quality . The camera hump is not so huge , considering the massive sensor inside . The curved gorilla glass on the front of the device is terrific and really adds to the unique design . The camera is also protected by gorilla glass .Screen For me , the visibility in sunlight is incredible . Colors really pop . It 's a full RGB AMOLED with Nokia 's Clear Black tech , so even though the 640x360 resolution is much less than the competitions ' resolution . . .the end result is quite OK for me .email Email client is solid .Keyboard OK , but getting an upgrade soon . You can also use the SWYPE keyboard , which can be downloaded for free .Navigation Two words awesome global .Call quality excellent .Signal Nokia is tops , as usual , in the signal reception area . In addition , this is a pentaband 3 .5 G phone . . .so you can take it just about anywhere in the world . Works on both ATT and Tmobile stateside .I can do a lot with this phone in terms of media creation and consumption . It handles all sorts of CODECs , allows full file access / wireless file transfer wifi , BT , USB On The Go , etc . etc .To really get the most out of this device , I installed 1 Opera Mobilefree , 2 Gravity for my Google Reader , Facebook , Foursquare and Twitter requirements15 bucks , 3 MS Office Suitefree , 4 Skype voice onlyfree , 5 MolomeIM client for free , 6 Nokia Socialfree , 7 CuteBox for dropboxfree and / or SugarSyncfree and / or Skyfilesfree , 8 HandySafe Pro3 bucks , 9 Nokia Sleeping Screenfree , Nokia Big Screenfree for HDMI output with remote to big screen TV .	1

I purchased a 2009 Yamaha 650 Silverado in August 2017 at Big 1 Motorsports . Jeff King did a smooth , efficient job on the sale , referring me to an insurance agent , in addition to getting the purchase done . Big 1 gave me a great deal on a snell rated , name brand helmet as well at the time of purchase . When I needed understandable ignition repair about a month later , AJ of the service department explained the time frame involved for repair , called to get authorization for the determined repair and price , and called to inform me when the bike was ready for pickup . The bike runs great since the repair . Therefore I give 5 stars to Big 1 for a job well done . All employees I have encountered there for any function or reason have done well .

I think I have around 5 battery packs now and this is my favorite , I 've ended up using this as a portable super battery for my tablet when I forget to juice it up overnight .ProsSolid built , good quality feelDoesn't seem limited in the devices that it works with some of my others do , which is really annoyingCharges itself wirelessly ! If you have a power mat or access to area with wireless charging note , it does not charge devices wirelessly , you still have to use a cable for thatbig storage , enough for charging 4 phones or 2 tablets to full2 .1amp output , the same as iPad charger so it charges most current tabbletsto charge it , it uses a micro usb plug . . .SO you can use the same usb to micro usb plug to charge it , then turn it around to charge your micro usb phoneLed lights to show powerConsWhile it 's not the infamous piano black , it 's still shows fingerprintsPricey over optionsDoesn't come with a power adapter , just microusb to USB which can then be reversed to charge your phoneThat last is n't a big deal for most as you probably have a dozen of them laying around . Any USB power source will work , even an iPad one .Note that it is 2 .1 amps across both connections so it would not charge two tablets simultaneously . Think of it as 2 phone OR 1 tablet at a time .I love this as I not only use it for travel , I use it as an emergency power supply when you do n't have time to charge it or forgot . OR if you want to use it and not be cabled to the outlet . I do n't have an extension to the couch so if my tablet runs out and do nt ' want to put it down while watching TV , i grab this .	1

In one sentence , if you are a heavy phone user , you wo n't be satisfied with its battery performance , otherwise it is generally an excellent Bluetooth headset . You should also know that this headset can only be worn on the right ear .Pros1 . This headset looks trendy and cool by itself , when worn on the ear , and when it 's in its Stone charger .2 . The fit to the ear is very comfortable .3 . The sound quality is excellent .4 . Voiceactivated dialing really works , even in noisy environment .5 . Pairing with your phone is automatic and quick .Cons1 . Being so compact and streamlined , your fingers need to aim pretty accurately when answering a call and adjusting sound volume .2 . Battery does n't last 8 hours straight you need to recharge it using the Stone charger after about two hours of continuous use .So it really comes down to how many hours you use your phone in a day . I do not use my cell phone for more than two hours per day , therefore I give it five stars for all the pluses that this headset has .	1

The sales associate was great ! Update I went in to get a bigger SUV and got it , just to have them a month later tell me I do n't make enough to have it . I made mor e than 4 times the car payment AFTER taxes . I talked to the manger about it over text for weeks . Then he tried to make it seem as if it was my fault because my dad said he did n't want to cosign income purposes because how the fucked me over . So , I called a lawyer and they told me what I needed to do . I told the person I was messaging with that I wanted my tradein and deposit back . He refused and said I can put you in another car . At this point the have had my car for over a month , they had nt even attempted to pay it off , and it got reported on my credit score taking it from a 600 something down to almost a 500 something . Now , with me needing a car because people depend on me to have one , I took it knowing I wanted and needed an SUV since I have two big dogs . Well , another month goes by and they still have yet to pay my trade in off . . . it hits my credit again taking it into the 400s . Currently speaking to a lawyer since no one at the the corporate or Affairs office or whatever it is will not contact me back . The ruin my credit and I was trying to buy a house in two years . They also over sold the car to be buy 2 K I have the online picture of the car I got with the online price . To top it off the push to start on a new car stop working within two 2 months of owning the car . Service was great at fixing it , but that should n't be an issue with a new car . Then I called the dealership before the 4th of July to tell them that my car was just eating away at my gas . . . i would go 6 mile and . it would use up 1215 miles of gas . . . without the ait on . They never called me back . Called today to set up an appointment and the girl tells me they ca n't give me a rental car . What do you mean ? I have dogs to walk during lunch and I have work to go to and to get back from plus I 'm a student . We have a shuttle . . . is your shuttle going to pick my fat ass up at 2 am to take me to get a shake ? No ? Okay I need a rental just like I need my car to do stuff . My point is . . . do nt shop at the Greenville location . I called another location about the issues and they even suggested that I speak with a lawyer . Save your money and credit score . Just copied my other post . People need to know how shady this office can be .	0
This product was recommended to me by a friend after he heard me complaining about not getting enough sleep . He said that he 'd used the product and swore by it 's ability to increase testosterone generation and put you to sleep in 2030 min , guarenteed .He was wrong , at least about the sleep part .At least in my experience , no matter how many suppliments you choke down , if you 're lifting right , you will have a dull ache regardless . Your muscles are torn and healing , and it sucks to experience . It makes falling asleep a nightmare too . Thus , when I was told about ZMA , I bought it using my android phone just so I could get it faster .It does nothing . I take it , and I feel no more sleepy than normal , I do n't fall asleep any faster , and I do n't rest any better .All in all , I may be an aboration . I may have gotten a bad batch of pills . Any number of things may have conspired to rob me of the worthwhile effects of this product . However , I wo n't give it another chance to rob me of my money . I would NOT recommend this product to anyone for any reason .	0

Even though I live closer to the East Hartford location , I always drive out of the way to New London to get my vehicle serviced . The staff at New London is super friendly and their service department will always address and solve the problem your vehicle is having rather than waving you off . Service is fast and thorough and they take no shortcuts . If you have purchased a vehicle from Hoffman Audi and need servicing , do not bother with the East Hartford location trust me and just go here .	1

I switched from this products competitor for no other reason than to just try something new and I wish I had n't . I do n't know how I missed the reviews that said it was not a lubricant , but I can now second that . The directions say to spray it on and let it dry before use , which I tried , and then I just tried spraying it on and shaving , but either way the blades heated up quickly and the razor grabbed at my face . The competition sold on amazon is MUCH better .	0
I first got these for one of my dogs for her skin allergies . I give her one of these every day along with a fish oil capsule , wrapped in a little slice of cheese . Her skin is totally great now .

Holster provides easyon and easyoff the pants / belt , and holds the covered phone well .

This does n't work at all for my Galaxy S4 . I tried several power supplies and it did n't make any difference . All those power supplies worked fine with my CHOE UPGRADED Qi Wireless Charger Charging Pad . This constantly turns on and off and beeps when it does so , which makes it useless in the bedroom . There should be a switch to disable the beep . Turning off the phone 's charging notification beep does n't make any difference because the pad has its own beeper . Could n't get it to work reliably with or without a phone case , or with any power supply . The fit and finish are very good , but the functionality is useless for me . I am very disappointed .	0

Car shopping can be frustrating on it own . With some dealers you feel like they only want to make a sale for their wallet . Not at cobb county kia .

She cares about what kind of car will best suit me and my family ! ! Keely has a way of making the process easy and headache free .

I would n't call myself a rechargeable battery specialist but , following the purchase of 2 ' robots ' for the kids that EACH require 12 AA batteries to operate my options were either go ' rechargeable ' or go bankrupt quickly . So , after some research , I went with 2eneloop Starter Kit in Blue Case Power Packplus this extra AA 8pack . Now , that we 've used them for a while , I can say that I am happy with what we got and we are likely to go ' eneloop ' again if we ever need more AA / AAA in the future .These are 1 .2V , 750 / 800 mAh AAA and 1900 / 2000 mAh AA NiMH batteries . According to Sanyo , they easily beat the ' regular NiMH ' competition when it comes to retaining their charge . Also according to Sanyo , the eneloops retain about 90 of their charge after 6 months and 85 after one year . Why is this important when it comes to rechargeable batteries ? I do n't know . What I do know is that I 've been using eneloops for quite a while and I 've been a happy user so far . Moreover , if ' authority ' can be invoked , my G700 Logitech gaming mouse came with an eneloop battery in it so there must be something good about a brand that both myself and Logitech have been using for a while .I am very happy with these rechargeables because they are saving me a lot of money and because they appear to be built to last for many hundreds or charges . The other thing I like about the eneloops is their color . I know that it may not seem too relevant but the fact is that we lost MANY rechargeable batteries by throwing them away because we forgot they were rechargeable and we forgot because they looks ' just like ' the other batteries . The white eneloops stand out and it is not likely that we will throw them away .For the sofar flawless battery performance , hardtomiss color and because they are already saving me money I can say that I do love these batteries and they get my 5star rating .	1
From this company are the best ! I had been getting the ones from GNC at twice the price and they worked but have added fillers in them . I borrowed some of my friends Raspberry Ketones that she purchased from this company and they work better than the expensive ones from GNC . The capsules are easy to swallow and as recommended I take two a day . In the months that I have been using the ketones I have lost close to forty pounds about 3 months steady . This company shipped this product super fast , super well packaged . I am looking for a better place to purchase my CLA from also . . .this may be the place . Excellent , product , excellent customer service , I 'll do business with them again .	1

There is nothing special about this tub / tile cleaners other than it sprays blue and gradually turns white . It also has the annoying cheap powdered detergent smell that they sell at 99 cent store .

Came quickly and in good condition . This product is one of the best products I 've ever purchased from Amazon . Since charging and using these batteries , my phone never goes dead before bedtime so I rarely change the battery . The real star of this deal is the charger . How nice it is to be able to charge a battery while using the phone elsewhere and always having a charged battery as backup just in case . The charger also is so universal that I have yet to find a 3 .7v battery that it wo n't charge . I use it to charge backup batteries for several cameras and phones besides my SGII . I highly recommend this item !	1

I purchased this to take as a mood and energy lifter . The first time I took one I felt awesome for about 2 hours then CRASH . I know other reviewers did not have this experience , but I did . All I wanted to do was sleep after the 2 hours . I felt like crap . I am very busy and could n't sleep so it really sucked . I later purchased the time release tablets since I read that it is important that the 5HTP is released in your intestines rather than stomach and that you want slow release of this . The time release went even worse . I felt moody , anxious and angry . I would not dissuade others from taking this because I know it is very beneficial for some , but just not for me .	0

I recently picked up a new 2018 4 series from Flemington BMW with help from master salesman and resident BMW guru , J . R . Nast . This was my second time working with J . R . and , once again , he was able to find exactly what I was looking for at a great price . Particularly impressive was the willingness to think outside the box to help get me the perfect car . For example , when it was discovered that black rims were not available , J . R . was able to have the factory rims powder coated in black without affecting my lease agreement . It is this commitment to excellence and customer sat that has made Flemington BMW my goto dealership for the past 9 years . I recommend it highly .	1
TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE . the manager blatantly ignored me when trying to check in , continued smoking his cigarette . my car has a piece that came unattached and is clearly a safety hazard . Save yourself the headache and disrespect and find another dealership in the area .	0
Like the other reviewer I have tried and liked several of the Satin Smooth waxes . I just tried this one for the first time and hated it . It was like using warm laughy taffy to wax with . Super sticky and messy . And it broke a ton of hairs so I got to spend 20 min plucking the stubble . I 'm bummed I spent 22 on it and will not use / buy again . I do n't think I would try another cream wax either . They seem to be more difficult .	0

So after reading all these reviews on here , I got a bit upset that such a lifesaving product that is being offered for so cheap is getting bagged on . Then again it could be the seller ? But there are two factors that could have an affect on your final product performance a how you assembled / disassembled your unit and b the quality of the product from the seller . If you love assembling things and have patience , go for this project . If you have big stubby fingers , are heavyhanded with tech , or think it 's as easy as fixing a pc go find someone on Craigslist who will let you watch them directly for the entire process . There are some screws in the corners of the iphone , and some screws that are as large as a couple grains of sand . I kid you not . If you like a challenge , and think you are up to the task , this may be the best thing you 've done for you wallet . I did not need them , but I think it would have made life a bit easier if I had a magnifying glass , magnetized Phillips heads , and ingrown hair tweezers . Though I was able to do it without them .I chose my replacement screen from the seller Buyiparts . On top of including an IPHONE TOOLKIT , they provided me with a screen protector already installed on the new screen ! If you 've already done work on your phone , you know that the front screen is going to be sliding all over the table . The fact that they put on a protector on the new one so I could reassemble the back of my phone without a worry , is very useful ! Before I get into the details I will say this I spent 28 dollars buying this compared to 200 sending it to Verizon , and 399 , in getting and upgrade to an iPhone 5 . Now , this is n't an easy fix . It took me 3 hrs to do it CAREFULLY . Carefully means using a windexsoaked paper towel on my fingertips every now and then to prevent the oil from my fingers to affect and damage the circuitry in the phone . You have to realize , when these things are being build in factories , employees wear gloves and machines do most of the work in the most biosecure factories in manufacturing . The fact that you will be doing this with some tool kit , albeit no surgical gloves on , and in a dusty environment means you need to really take care of all the parts of the phone you will be removing and take extra precautions ! Using windex on metalmetal contacts , following IFIXIT 's google it tutorials for replacing your iPhone 4 screen and most importantly TAKING YOUR TIME ! The reason I will not take this to a Verizon retailer or someone on craigslist for slightly more money , is because I prefer not to just hand someone my contacts , photos , calendar and private information that they have multiple days with and can easily decrypt at their leisure . In a world where privacy is paramount , I at least wo n't take that risk . Plus , it worked out and I saved myself 200300 bucks which i think i might spend on a nice dinner .So onto this product ! The seller I can speak volumes for because they thought of everything . The toolkit that sells for 20 online , and the screen protector already on it . I will say this though ! Use iFixit 's website to get a tutorial but iPhone 4 guides are mostly written for att / sprint versions . You may think that there are tiny differences in comparison to Verizon 's version , but on the contrary , it 's a lot bigger as far as component placement goes . In the end , it really comes down to being careful and not in a rush . The smallest tear in one of the circuit ribbons can be the difference in a random white line or blank screen . Holding the wifi antenna with your finger tips and letting the oily residue of your fingers make contact can cause interference with your wifi signal all the smallest of things can make this go wrong and is n't the fault of the screen itself ! I constantly refer to the replacement iphone 4 guide on ifixit 's website but it ONLY works if you follow it to the T . All the warnings of do n't let your fingers make contact with the circuitry board or connectors , are all valuable tips to follow . My belief is that somewhere along the process , one of the negative reviewers may have made the slightest slip did not put the correct screw back , caused a microtear in one of the ribbons , or simply did not push a connector firmly enough and now woe is them , the product is defective .I will say you absolutely need thin rubber gloves , tweazers , a large work space with a WHITE base losing a screw can add an hour to your project especially when they are no more than a couple grains of sand , a ipod / iphone toolkit depending on your seller , and ifixit 's guide to removing your screen . Keep in mind I did this without all the luxuries above so do n't worry , its very possible ! ! ! A couple tips I did Every step on the tutorial I went through , I sectioned off the parts screws that corresponded to it . Ex 22 steps on the guide . Therefore , 22 sections of screws / parts . This makes reassembly much easier ! I also HIGHLY recommend taking pictures as you go . If your screws get mixed up cuz kitty jumps on the table , its a lifesaver having a picture of the particular area of the phone before you removed the screw . There are many different types of screws in your phone so its important to take pics before every step . Sometimes you might find a step that does n't apply to your particular phone in that case , its good to have a pic of the phone at that stage so you know what goes where during reassembly .Let me tell you this spending 28 bucks on this and getting it to work is much better than spending 199 to your cellular carrier and you being out of a ton of money . If you mess up and it does not work and you end up sending it to your carrier to fix then that 200 becomes 228 . If you are spending over 200 anyway , adding 28 is not going to kill you . In my opinion , if you are technologically inclined and like challenges and are motivated it wo n't hurt to try this option and end up saving so much money . It 's literally a risk vs . reward scenario . I happened to be on the reward end because I stuck it out the 3hrs and managed to get the gosh darn stupid tiny screws in difficult to reach places . And the only downside . . .i have 1 pixel that is whited out . look at another iphone real closely till you see tiny tiny squares . Now , take one of those out of thousands and thousands , and turn it white . I can live with that . What I ca n't live with , is 200 out of my pocket . GOODLUCK EVERYONE ! Please give it a go and empower yourselves !	1

Bought this for my son , loved the price and I really like how it fits . It keeps him protected from the sun and so far it has held well after using it in the pool everyday . I bought a white one and a red one , both are great . The red one bled a little the first time I washed it in the washer , so be aware of that . Other than that these shirts are awesome !	1

We have recently been on the lookout for a Lexus hybrid a CT200h to be exact . We searched Autotrader and other sites to find one and came across one at Performance Lexus . Upon recommendations from others we traveled north to check it out . We were greeted by the smiling receptionists at the entrance to a beautiful dealership hands down nicest I have ever entered . We then meet with the sales manager and he set us up with Ben Halpin . He graciously offered the lounge area for my children to watch Sunday football while my wife and I looked at the car . From the beginning , he was never salesy he always answered our questions honestly and with a smile . He was curious about our situation and tried his best to accommodate our schedule throughout . Ben was the friendliest salesman I have worked with to date and I have been through many car purchases with my wife over the past 10 years . I had some pretty sour car buying experiences in the past , however , I was pleasantly surprised this was not the same in any way . I ended up buying the certified CT200h for my wife because in the end they did not stop until we had the deal we wanted . I know they are in the car sales business but they went above and beyond to meet our needs . My wife and I without any hesitation would buy a car again from Performance Lexus . I look forward to utilizing the amenities the dealership offers . I would recommend them to others not only for car buying experience but also the service . If the car buying experience is this good I am confident the service department is top notch . I will return to Performance when the time comes to buy another Lexus . They showed me what car buying should be like .	1

After using it once or twice and charging it , it starts to NOT fully charge . Or if it says 100 as soon as you unplug it it goes to 86 and for a while when I was using it it made my phone REALLY HOT where I could n't hold it ! Ouch ! ! ! Careful guys !	0
I bought this for my college roommate since her favorite type of gold is Rose gold . The rose gold overlay on the sterling silver is absolutely perfect for my budget . The length is great and it feels like a solid piece .

Be careful if you are sensitive to caffiene . I used these for 2 days . I did not sleep either night . And I took them before lunch . I bought mine at GNC and returned them today . I also felt very bloated when I used them , as if I had not taken them . This is how I feel when I carb load . My heart was racing and headache was soooo bad ! So they did not work for me . I know not all products work the same for everyone . But I would not recommend these to anyone with a caffiene sensitivity .	0

These shoes are just a teeny bit tight , but otherwise fit great . I love the placement of the heel it 's not too far back on the shoe . Therefore , these shoes have great stability and are fairly comfortable considering they are heels , after all .	1
I have two pairs of this shoe in black patent , and one each in navy kid and red patent . They are easy and comfortable to wear to work and go easily into the evening . The best find I have made for shoes . The size is correct , no problem with length or width in my normal 9 and a half medium . They are not made to walk long distance as they are made of fine leather not walking shoes but sidewalk walking is fine for medium distances . The heel height is enough to give one grace but not more . A perfect shoe .	1
Crappy quality . They look and feel totally ghetto . I was highly disappointed . Better luck at destination maternity and maternity wear by Heidi Klum at macys	0

ALl I can say is do n't listen or pay attention to any of the bad reviews you see or hear . I got this headset about 5 months ago and they are STILL going strong . They are light weight , cause no pain what so ever to the ear and a VERY durable ! Will never trust any other Brand except Motorola as far as headsets go because they clearly know their stuff !	1

I have wide feet E width and they 've been sensitive ever since I had plantar fasciitis a few years ago . I do n't have time or energy to search a dozen shoe stores for good quality shoes in my size , so it 's really wonderful to be able to order them online . The Romy shoes I received a couple of weeks ago fit perfectly and are very comfortable no squeezing my toes , no pressure points . My feet actually do n't hurt after wearing them all day , even after quite a bit of walking . I 've already ordered another pair , and am going to try another Easy Spirit style .	1
Excellent functionality and look . I like in particular that I can place an iPhone WITH CASE in this dock , which is not true for most docks . I simply did not use any of the inserts . I use one at my work desk and one in my home . I hope they make this for iPhone 5s as I am upgrading soon . . .	1

If I could give this dealership a ZERO I would . Their service department should tell you that they are NOT providing a LOANER vehicle that 's at their dealership . I had an appt scheduled 3 weeks ago for a loaner with Lexus of Charleston . However , when I arrived ON TIME for my appt , after I checked in , I had to wait 30 mins in Lexus waiting room for my loaner and then I discovered that I was being given a ride to Enterprise Car Rental down the street . Where there is currently no vehicles in stock . It would 've been nice to know this up front as I would 've just rather waited on my vehicle . Piss poor customer service ! ! ! ! !	0

You will call a million times , no one will ever be available to speak with once transferred to that department so you 'll leave a million messages and they will not return your call .

Problem The cutout at the bottom for the charger opening only fit the stock charger that came with my cell phone .

Over Priced Dealer ! ! I have been to this dealership twice and walked out without leasing anything . They do n't even match the competitor 's price nor the lease payment . Their price on a same equip car was Thousands more and over 200 more in the lease payment and that was after negotiations . The salesperson Pieter was great and very helpful but unfortunately I ca nt say the same about the management . There are at least 5 dealerships within 50 miles radius . Take your business to the dealers who want to do business . I am not sure how Irvine BMW sustain their business .	0

I bought a KTM 990 ADV R here . Months later i had the rear tire replaced and they scratched the wheel down to the bare metal digging the ballance weight off . I watched the service guy do it with a big screwdriver ! I said you just put the first damage scratch on my wheel and they refused to fix it and told me they will never service my bike ever again . Months later i had a ktm warranty covered problem that needed to be repaired again they refused to even cover that . Once again they told me the owner said they will never honor kym warrenty or work / service my bike again . DONT USE THIS PLACE THEY ARE NOT UP TO DEALER STANDARDS AND DONT CARE IF YOU LEAVE UNSATISFIED IN ANY WAY ON THERE DAMAGE OR NEGLECT ON YOUR BIKE	0
I like dettol and have used it since childhood . . . I however never saw a dettol bottle without sealed cap . . . until now . There was a sellotape on the plastic cap . That 's it . No other ' twisttobreak ' seal or seal inside the cap . Disappointing . Update I have been dealing with skin disease fungal infection as a result of using this for more than a year .

I have nothing positive to say about these vantage paper towels . Total fail in my opinion . If you like a stiff paper towel that spins off the roll so fast you get 10 sheets when you wanted one , you 'll like these . They remind me of a generic brand with a fancy pattern to fool people into thinking they 're better . Personally I think they absorb less than the standard Vivas , you get less per roll , and they fall apart easier when wet . I bought a box of these on 34subscribe and save34 so I have to use them up but I curse every time I have to use a vantage paper towel . I literally cringe and growl at these . I ca n't wait to go back to the regular Vivas . PS . I love the regular Vivas .	0

I highly recommend these drops if you suffer from allergy eyes . They work immediately for me and I stock up on them and keep them in my cabinet . You never know when you 'll have a flare up .This company makes several different formulas and I suggest you try them all . With the economy in dire straights and our pockets empty , most people ca n't afford to run to the eye doctor for every little symptom . I find that these do the trick without all the drama of DR appointments , time restraints or lack of money . . . .Here 's to healthy eyes ! !	1
My repair was supposed to take 1 day and ended up taking 3 days . There was little to no communication by the service person informing me of the status . I had to make multiple calls and one of the days my service person was off , the person that help me was extremely rude . This is not the first time i have had this type of service from this dealership . In fact every time i have been to this dealership they never deliver the on time in and are very unprofessional . This dealership does not live up to the standard of a true Cadillac dealership , i feel like i am going to a shady used car lot every time i visit this dealership . I will never go here again even though it will mean i have to travel further to go to a good Cadillac dealership with good customer service like Sewell Cadillac .	0

This garment literally feels like it is made from scratchy , paperthin plastic . The material does n't even feel like something that should be used to make clothing . I returned it without even trying it on . Once I removed it from the packaging and felt the material , my hands started to itch . Also , there are stray threads sticking out of the stitching in most of the seems . I immediately wrapped it back up for return .	0
Service Department . Our 2016 Lexus was in an accident . We had no knowledge that Lexus has no autobody shop . When the wrecker took the car to Lexus on SR 436 , about four service reps came out and told me and the wrecker that they do n't hold wrecked vehicles to not drop it and get it off their property . Very UNPROFESSIONAL as if I was aware of this I would not have taken it there . There was no solution or explanation . We were told to just take it elsewhere . It is funny how they bend backwards to SELL A CAR , SELL A PRITTY SERVICE DEPARTMENT but get the HELL OFF SITE if your vehicle is WRECKED . Needless to say , THANK YOU LEXUS OF ORLANDO for the UNKNOWN insight of your CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE . NO LONGER A CUSTOMER OF YOUR DEALERSHIP .	0

Did not get these from Amazon but found out that Amazon has the most colors of Ugg boots and slippers than any other company . I always search different outlets for sales on the Uggs that I want to purchase . I already found slippers and boots for all my children and grandchildren for next Christmas . Am so delighted with Ugg and the Pineneedle is an amazing color of forest green . I already have a great collection of colors and styles of Ugg . I only order the Classic Short or Bailey Button in the boots but have about 5 styles of slippers in Ugg . The Classic Short is my favorite . Also , the older boots ran about a size larger but now run true to size . Walmart has three types of silicon spray for abut 8 and before I wear them I spray with the strongest spray to waterproof and also preserve the color . Thanks for looking at my review ! I 'm an Ugg Aholic ! Amd I 'm going broke buying them ! Thanks for looking ! p .s . the silicon spray never changes the color !	1

Buying a BMW go to HartfordIf you are looking to lease or purchase a BMW drive to Hartford . I purchased one vehicle and leased a second 3 years ago . Have had the worst experience with the sales group at Gengras BMW of West Springfield . I m giving One star because the service group deserves five stars but the sales group took four away . As I told my sales person that my experience makes me want to move to a different product I was told I understand really that s how you respond to a customer who wants to purchase the lease and another vehicle .	0
The consistency of our experience is Exceptional ! The consistency of our service experience is an absolute delight ! One of the most important things to us in choosing a dealership is the After Care and Checkered Flag has over delivered on our last 2 purchases ! Phillippe Liedl , it is actually a pleasure to bring our Macan in for service OK we do not want anything wrong . . but when it happens we know we are in good hands ! . During our last visit I had a loaner Macan while mine was in service . I was running late to go our of town so the loaner was packed to the ceiling . Jay sorry , no last name was there to assist in not only bringing my Macan around close to the loaner , but also unloaded everything into my car before I could even get back to it ! Total Car swap in under 5 minutes ! Now that is a pleasure !	1
Never have parts in stockIf I could rate this place with a negative , I would . Twice I have made an appointment , driven the 40 minutes it takes to get there , without traffic , sat and waited for a very long time , and then been told that the part is not in stock . The part for which I made an appointment , is not in stock . Each time I am told part is not in stock , it is not even done with an apology , just a half hearted shrug as if they can not explain what 's happening . What 's happening is terrible customer service and the inability to do a job well . If you can take your business elsewhere , do so .	0
I love these rings . They are beautiful and sparkly . I love how the 3 rings can be worn together , as a pair , or just one ring . The only negative thing I can say about this set is that they can be a bit uncomfortable to wear . The rings seem to poke out and hit my neighboring fingers . After wearing a few times , I do n't even notice this anymore . I 'm very pleased with this purchase , they are very beautiful rings .	1

As soon as I removed the leather belt from its plastic bag , it reeked of some sort of chemical smell . It continued to offgas something terrible all day , so I put it on the outside doorknob of my apartment entrance door . Three days later , it was still offgassing , so I returned it . A neighbor suggested the belt may have been chemically treated to prevent mildew while it sat in a warehouse . I would n't recommend this belt to anyone .	0
Do yourself a favor DO NOT buy a car from this dealership , NOT worth it ! If you really want a KIA go to the one is more up north they have BETTER customer service there . If I had the option not to put one star I would but it does n't work I tried . We just bought a new car at that location and we 've had nothing but issues with them about the car we just got . FIRST We took it to get our windows done , tires lock , etc . It took two days to do that , and apparently did n't finish the job . SECOND after the work was done they returned our New car with scratches on the front bumper , broken piece and a dent on the car . THIRD customer service is TERRIBLE from the service department Jannette lady is always up front , even sales managers J . Aguillon and the guy that is supposed to answer every question you have in the moment you have to sign all the paper work Salazar are completely RUDE and with NO EDUCATION what so ever Perla C . , just because you speak Spanish they assumed your ignorant and stupid but the TRUTH is that other people have more education and manners then all of them ! Sales people there are super PUSHY , they want you to buy the car THEY want so they can get all the used cars or messed up ones out and not the one your are actually willing to buy . NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR TIME HERE ! ! ! ! Go somewhere else where you would be treat it with RESPECT AND MANNERS . Lastly , ALL the good comments here are completely FAKE there is NOT one good thing about this place AT ALL .	0

Get your car here , but never come back . Worst service department ever . 10 hours waiting for them to tell me I had flat spots on my tires , of course they did n't Replace the tires I had to come back because Nalley and BMW had nail down who would pay . Upon return to get the new tires , it took 4 . 5 hours to get them out on . Second issue appeared with the car the next weekend . It was the rear brakes . I needed new pads and rotors . Instead of giving me new rotors they decided to turn the ones that were on the car . For those who do n't know rotors , you can only turn these a couple of times . I 'm sure they will need to be replaced on my dime earlier than it should be . Oh , this too another 9 . 5 hours . Get your car here and never come back .	0

I decided to take a chance on these inserts and I am very disappointed . These are my complaints1 My major complaint is that I ordered the 3 which is supposed to be size 910 for women . However , they are larger that . I could not get this in my size 9 or 10 shoes or boots . Instead I have a pair of size 11 boots that are loose on me where these inserts fit in snugly .2 Another disappointment is that they are hard . I expected a softer insole , so I find walking on this almost similar to walking on a bare floor .3 Third , I have high arches and the arch support is not high enough for me .4 They are cheaply made . The picture of the product makes these look very plush but they are not . They are especially thin in the ball and toe area of the foot .I wish I had not discounted the negative reviews on this site so readily . The reason I tried these is becuase I wanted to try someting that would help plantar fasciitis which some reviewers said worked for them and some did n't . However , although they provide some cushioning , they are definitely not for me and they run a size too big in my opinion . Had I seen these in a store and examined them , I would have never purchased them .	0

Thank goodness Amazon has an amazing return policy . I was disappointed as the pink ifrogz case withstood a lot of abuse from my toddler .	0

I do not like this vitamin or any vitamin like it because it is so out of balance that it creates health problems the same as some medications do , in my most humble opinion . I bought this without reading the label and gave it to my husband and in a few weeks he developed hemeroids . He asked me if their was something different that he was taking and I said yes , the Nature Maid Super B Complex . I knew immediately what it was because it was the only thing new that he had taken . According to Adele Davis the famous nutritionist , all the B 's have to be perfectly balanced . In her book 34lets get well34 she states that B1 , B2 and B6 have to be the identical amount or the serious health problems will start . This vitamin is so out of balance it has 20 mg . of B2 and just 2 mg . of B6 then they have 100 mg . of B1 . and 5 .5 mg of B5 . It is just nuts , in my humble opinion . It 's a crap shoot . When you have the large amount of B1 and large amount of B2 and practically no B6 2 mg that is a recipe for Piles and eye problems like Granulated red eyes and eyelids , constant tearing of the eyes and just burning and blurry eyes especially if you are on the net all the time . The high B1 and high B2 is destroying the B6 . The high B1 is destroying the B2 and the B6 . The B5 is supposed to be at least 40 mg . higher than the B1 , b2 and B6 and so is the Niacin so the B5 is being destroyed . B5 is for your adrenal glands so this is not good in my opinion . The high B1 is destroying the B5 and the B3 , B2 , B6 , and God knows what else . B3 or Niacin prevents Alzheimers that is the Reason Duke University said that Alzheimers will be treated in the future with a nicotine patch . Cigarettes have B3 or Niacin in them and every time you puff it flushes your brain with Niacin and calms you down and helps you to concentrate . I 'm not pushing smoking . Connect the dots . I am merely stating what the 34good 34 and honest doctors said . Good and Honest doctors are rare in this country . Davis said that the way you can spot a good B complex is if it has 150 mcg . of Biotin , this stuff has 30mcg . Please read Let 's Get Well , you can get it new or used on amazon . Read it and memorize this information . Vitamins are medication and the more health problems they cause the more you will buy more vitamins to cure the problems that are being caused by unbalanced B Complex , unbalance minerals , trace minerals and amino acids . It is the same with Calcium and Magnesium . Low Magnesium causes serious heart problems and heart attacks are the Number One Killer of women , not breast cancer . That is because women pump themselves full of calcium and extra calcium in Orange juice and other products without balancing their Magnesium intake . They think it prevents Osteoporosis and did not do the research on magnesium . They do n't do the research PERIOD they believe whatever is advertised . Do not believe me , do the research for yourself . It is so frightening to me that I do not take any calcium products or extra calcium added to foods , I just take Magnesium Glycinate Metigenics from amazon . Too much will have you running to the bathroom so do not take it and go our to work or school and start with one before bed . It is called the Charm Mineral because it relaxes your nerves . Calcium or Vit .D makes me very tired and causes me to get Bursitis . You do n't have to be a brain surgeon to understand how to do this you just have to read the book so you do n't destroy your health . I am not a doctor and I would not want to be a doctor in this health nightmare we are living in in this country .Ms . Davis gave up everything to publish that book along with her other books . I am going back to Solgar B complex . Solgar is an ethical vitamin company but they are not on Subscribe and Save so I purchased this one . I ca n't get a refund but I immediately cancelled it on Subscribe and Save .You ca n't read most labels on amazon because amazon is not a vitamin company , per say . I should have checked the label in another vitamin store on the net before I ordered it , my fault .because I know better . I have been studying vitamins for 50 years because I wanted to have healthy children . I am not a nutritionist either but I do know how dangerous vitamins can really hurt you because I read Ms . Davis ' book Lets Get Well in the 60 's and have seen so much damage because folks do not understand how B vitamins , minerals , trace mineral and amino acids have to be balanced just like food has to be balanced in a meal . Protein meat , fish or chicken Complex Carbhydratevegetable and one Carbohydrate or starch potato or brown rice , for example . Omega 36 and 9 's all must be balanced and Americans are getting way too much Omega 6 's and not enough Omega 3 's , that is the reason I use Canola oil for cooking and not so much Olive Oil . I just use Olive oil in a salad because it taste good but I still add a little Canola . I am afraid of too much Omega 6 . If this information helps just one person I will be happy . Be careful out there and please read Lets Get Well because they do not write or print books like that and never will . It took a lot of courage for her to write a book like that and I do not know of anywhere else you can purchase it but 34 good ol' amazon34 . I love , love and love amazon .They have everything you can not purchase in stores today like Concentrated Lysol for a disinfectant . Love ya , amazon	0

Okay , I was , and am often skeptical of all of these gimmick weight loss products that the make seem so appealing all the freakin ' time . Most companies tend to overadvertise the rare occurences that someone conveniently loses weight , on the off chance that they product actually did it .Well , I started taking this about a month agoand I can honestly say that I see a HUGE DIFFERENCE ! I have tried the HCG craze , and just about every other diet thing you can thing of . . .this has worked the best for me so far . I have ordered six , and will likely go through all of those to get exactly where I want to be Now , this is n't to say that you will see results overnight , but you will notice an immediate change in both your energy levels and appetite suppressant factor . I noticed a huge increase in energy , but not the kind of weird buzzy feeling you get when you have too many red bulls . I guess the best way to describe it was that I felt goodreally good like I actually wanted to work out . Of course , I suppressed this feeling because I strongly hate exercising . I know , tsk tsk .The directions state to take one twice a day for the first two days , then two a day twice a day for the next to days , then 2 3X a day after that . I find that to be overkill , and not necessary . I also found that I do n't sleep as well if I take them three times a day . ALSO , I am extremely prone to migraines , and I do not want to chance these things giving me one , so I 'm pretty darn content with my 2 2X per day routine I currently have in place .I know you are all wondering so how many pounds have you freakin ' lost already ? I 'm with you . But I do feel compelled to let you know that I 'm in Iraq and am not privy to a scale like I have at home . Sorry . But I HAVE noticed that all of my pants that were previously tight are now SO much looser , and the compliments are now rolling in I honestly ca n't say if it has to do with the 130140 degree days we are having out here , or whatbut I 'm losing weight either way so I 'm happy about that ! Last summer when I was in Iraq , I somehow managed to gain weight . . .don't know how in the world that happened . . . .lol . Needless to say , I 'm very happy about this now ! Even my tummy seems to be doing a disappearing act . Which I 'm pretty pleased about . . .My favorite compliment thus far It looks like you are shrinking ! To which I nonchalantly replied that I have a tapeworm . Hey , a girl has to keep her secrets , right ? 's Works , makes you actually want to work out if you are into that sort of thing . . . . and definitely brings results . Oh yeah , shipping was pretty quick too . I was just about to complain about shipping when it got here the next day . That 's how it works , is n't it ? But again I 'm in freakin Iraq so mail takes a bit longer to get here since it all arrives by convoy . 's None yetjust remember to drink water and not take so many that you get the jitters . Pay attention to your body .Bottom Line Does n't hurt to try ! It is working for me , so I 'll keep using it until I find a reason not to . In which case , I 'll be more than happy to update this review ! Hannah	1

This is a comedy of errors but I am writing it in case anyone else runs into any of the same situations . My wife and I have excellent cell phone service with Consumer Cellular CC , a no contract provider . I had bought her a Motorola Bravo from them and they sent a regular size sim card which works perfectly . My wife 's Chrysler 300C was starting to require many repairs and she was wanting to replace it with a Jeep . I bought her a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited but her Motorola Bravo is not compatible with the Jeep Voice Command System . I decided to go all out and bought her an unlocked iphone 5 which I expected to be compatible with both the Jeep Voice Command System and with our carrier , Consumer Cellular . My only concern was how to get the regular sim card in my wife 's Motorola Bravo cell phone down to nano size to fit the Apple . However , I figured that CC would have a solution such as sending a nano sim card and deactivating the Motorola Bravo sim card . As I wrote , I just took it for granted that this allegedly latest and greatest engineering wonder according to the ads would be compatible with both the Jeep and CC . So I ordered the outrageously priced unlocked iphone 5 . As usual , Amazon quickly processed my order and notified me that the phone had been shipped .I called CC to request a nano sim and was told by two different reps that the iphone 5 is not compatible with their service . I decided that I would keep CC as my server but when the iphone 5 arrived I would take it down to Walmart and sign my wife up for StraightTalk which is also a no contract server and which advertises the iphone 5 in their ads . The phone arrived in a small box , the kind that has a tearoff strip along one edge . There was no packing in the box . One end of the box was open and the cellophane wrapping was torn and disheveled . I had no way of testing the phone to check for internal damage and I had enough drama so I sent it back and bought my wife a Samsung Focus 2 for about one fourth the price of the iphone 5 . I called CC and they shipped a micro sim which should arrive in a few days . Obviously CC must believe that this phone is compatible with them but as for the jeep it is anyones guess .This is where my soap opera ends as far as this review is concerned . The moral of the story is that it would behoove anyone who is in the market for a 2014 vehicle with Voice Command features or is considering a new cell phone which would be used with your existing carrier or would be paired with your vehicle to do a thorough amount of research to avoid duplicating my experiences . One final note . My cell phone is a Sony Xperia P which I bought from Amazon . It works perfectly with CC and pairs and connects perfectly with my wife 's Jeep . If her Samsung has any compatibility issues I will end the drama and give her my Sony . Then I wil punt .	0
I think the floss sticks are much more convenient and less messy than the long string ones .And Plackers makes a pretty good product these are very strong but not too thick . It has a strong minty flavor too that makes you feel fresher .Do floss daily and if you are in the market for flossers these are awesome	1
Do not take you car here for service ! I took my car in for a factory recall and they broke my dash board and lied to my face about it . And refused to fix it . Worst customer service ever ! Stay far away from Hudson Nissan ! ! !	0
Order these in a size larger than your ordinary fit . The lining makes the fit snug and will be too tight if ordered in a regular size . If you have the proper fit they are great for long walks in moderately cold weather .	1

Delivery was fast . The replacement piece for the back of the EVO is nice , fits well , very functional . I actually really like the added size and weight , makes it easy to hold the phone firmly . The battery is unimpressive . I have been using it for about a week and it holds a charge no longer than my original HTC battery about 56 hours some listening to MP3s , occassional 4 G use , occassional WiFi , lots of 3 G web surfing , talking about 2030minutes per day . I do not feel totally ripped off as the back piece is really nice . I will likely buy another battery from a reputable manufacturer , having learned my lesson if it sounds too good to be true . . . .I have read the breadth of reviews and have come to the conclusion that purchasing from this manufacturer is ' hit or miss ' . Take the chance if you want to , if you want to be sure your getting a quality battery buy from another manufacturer .	0
i was surprised once i bought a ticket through fandango w that i could not just walk in the theater with it . . instead i had to wait in a long line . . . . so am not sure what the advantage is to buy through you except that ican be assured of a seat if it is over crowded . . . . which it never is .	0

unable to purchase tickets . web site keeps giving me session timed out error messaeg when i am not logged on or exceeded time limit for ticket purchasing , very frustrating . if i did not have a fandango gift card , i wouild not return here for future purchases .	0
i have been using fandango for some time now . not often because we do n't go to movies very often at the prices thy charge , but fandango was convenient . now we no longer have the option to print our tickets at home and walk into the theater and bypass the line for the box office which blocks the kiosk . given that we now have to deal with that , what is the advantage of fandango ? i still have to deal with the lines and people blocking the kiosk access .	0
Dissapointed , noone makes a good tshirt anymore ! I like the tank tops from russel but these shirts are horrible .The texture of the shirt is very very scratchy , and they wrinkle pretty bad .

Poise Panty Fresheners , 24 CountI was really surprised at the small size of the Poise Panty Fresheners . I tried them and I never could smell any gentle scent . When I tried to remove them they left an adhesive mark on the panty . What is up with that ? I agree that for feminine hygiene , the best article is a scented panty liner that does n't leave the adhesive when you remove it .	0

This cushion is hard , so hard it feels like a piece of hard foam . I tried it once and that was enough for me to not use it again .

If your chair has some kind of cushion , do n't waste your money as , again , this cushion is HARD .	0

The charger works great . Gives the phone a quick strong charge . Only thing that I do n't care for is the cord could be longer or at least not be so curly . When I want to use the charger I have to stretch the cord out so it does n't pull my phone off of my lap or the passenger seat . Other than that it 's a great small car charger .	1

I bought the Joby Gorillamobile for ATT and Verizon iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S . I promptly returned it and bought instead the Joby GorillaPod .Joby Gorillamobile works as advertised , but it does n't work as well as Joby makes it sound .Bottom Line iPhone mounted to the Gorillamobile is unstable , offbalance , ca n't be used with another tripod . Instead , buy the combination of Joby GorillaPod with Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip . That combination makes iPhone mount to any tripod with the security you are seeking .For Joby Gorillamobile , you need to use the special iPhone case they provide . The case feels junky . It 's hard to use . It looks like Apple 's Bumpers , but it 's hard , shiny plastic . A bit slippery .Joby Gorillamobile iPhone case then mounts to a special tiny slider mount , which fits into Gorillamobile 's screw head . The mount is secure , but Gorillamobile feels lightweight , offbalance and insecure with iPhone mounted . The tiny slider mount will not fit into Joby 's own larger Gorillapod or any other tripod . Joby provides an extra mounting screw , but it feels kludgy and difficult to use . There is also the problem of having yet another small piece of hardware to carry around with you . . . .And , you can not move the camera from landscape view to portrait view hanging off the side of Joby Gorillamobile . Even if you could , the thing would tip over .I was completely unsatisfied with the product , and returned it to Amazon no hassle there .I replaced it with the combination of Joby GorillaPod with Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip . That combination is great for securely mounting iPhone to a tripod .	0

If I could give negative stars , I would . This was the absolute worst buying experience of my life ! They were very shady , dishonest , and treated us very poorly specifically , Jake , the sales manager . We went in to look at a Pathfinder we had seen online . When we first looked at it , it had n't been through the shop or anything but they still tried to get us under contract . We decided to come back two days later to make a decision . When we came back to put money down they told us the price had risen 600 ! Can anyone say bait and switch ? ! We refused to pay the new price but put money down on with the stipulation that certain items be fixed . When I came , a week later , to pick up the car , only one of of those items were finished , there was still garbage in the vehicle , and paint scuffs on the exterior that Jake had assured me would buff right out . Jake said they would fix an additional item we were concerned about as well . We live an hour and a half away so they said we could possibly have someone fix that issue where we live and send them the bill or just come back down to get them fixed . I decided to leave it there for two more weeks . He looked me in the face and said it 's not in the contract or anything but we 'll take care of you and gave me his cell . Man , I ca n't believe I fell for that . I texted , called , left messages with the receptionist , left messages with Jake , left messages with my salesman before and after I picked up my car and Jake has yet to get back to me . Hmmmm . . . . He gives me his number and tells me to contact him , makes a promise to fix something and then dodges me until I just give up . Super , super shady . They had my car for three weeks and still did n't fix everything they promised me . I told them I did n't want the car then and I wanted my money back . They just said there was nothing they could do cause my loan already went through . I 've never been treated so poorly in my life . They really could n't care less about you , they just want to get the sale . Safe your self the hassle and go somewhere else . Update I spoke with Micall Johnson , one of the customer service managers , and she was very nice , empathetic , and treated me with respect . She said they would like to resolve our issues and that she would have Jake or another sales manager call me by the end of the day . It 's been two months and surprise surprise , I have yet to receive a phone call from anyone . 500 in repairs later with more pending and no word from anyone . I ca n't express how disgusted I am with this style of business . I will do my absolute best to deter anyone from using this dealership and going through the same experience I had .	0

We own 4 MB 's 2 newer 2 older . We 've used Ganley MB in Akron for service since 2008 . I guess we got spoiled . I had an older MB towed in on a Saturday for service . I called ahead during normal hours and got voice mail so I left a message . I called back Monday late morning again , left message , called Tuesday late morning again , left a message . So far no call backs . About noon Tuesday , I called and waited until i could speak to a person . She could n't verify they 've received the car but would call me right back 3 pm i called and spoke to MB service manager , he had to check and call me back . He did ! Wow , all he could do 48 hours later is tell they had they car . I called Performance Auto , also in Columbus , they dispatched a tow truck , I met the tow truck at the dealer and had it towed after hours on Tuesday . Wednesday at 3 pm the car is fixed . I recommend Performance Auto anytime you need a MB serviced on the greater CBus area . I would never consider MercedesBenz of Easton for anyting .	0

Went there to buy a car with my girlfriend . The salesman told me she might not be able to buy the vehicle because of her income . I agreed for them to run my credit 1time . I repeat 1 time . The salesman was gone 5 minutes . He returned and said , we do n't need you to cosign she is fine by herself . I said awesome , and she bought the car the next day . Looked at my credit report , and hey had ran my credit 9 times ! 9 times . On two separate days as well . Spoke with the assistant manager and he had done nothing like what he said he would with the adverse actions . It 's been two weeks since he said he was gon na call me . Spoke to a gentleman yesterday . He told me he would call me back before the end of the day . He did not . This dealer lacks a lot of things . First is you do not shotgun someone 's credit . Second is if you tell a customer something you follow through with it . They are awful . I recommend everyone stay away for the reasons of they honestly could care less about you as a customer . They just want the money no matter what it effects .	0

After getting this battery I was stoked . Longer life for my killer phone ! I did nt mind that it added weight and size to the phone , it was a scarifice I was willing to accept . I charged it as instructed and began use . The battery seemed to maybe last a little longer , but it was hard to tell . Well , its months later and the batter mayve lasts 23 hours under normal use . Its a piece of crap and has only one use . . .as an entertainment device to watch as your throw it over a bridge or try and skip it across the water . DONT BUY THIS JUNK !	0

The service department is a disaster . Be prepared to wait to get a loaner car , wait to get seen , wait when going to pickup , wait for the car to be brought around . I get that waiting is part of the process but here it 's extreme . One hand does n't talk to the other . I had to tell multiple workers what I was waiting for and they would check and usually the excuse was that no one told me you were here and eventually I walked back to look for my car myself . The real problem is that the Service department does n't keep their word . When my car was under warranty , I had a problem with my console / navigation / radio would crash / reboot itself during the first drive of the day sometimes 3 times in a row . The service dept could not reproduce this issue . I told them it happens 80 of the time so I understood when they could n't reproduce the problem . I did ask if they could fix this problem if I brought it in again as my pricy warranty was ending in the next few months . They said they would . So here I am at BMW getting the defective airbags replaced and asked them to fix the console . This time they can reproduce the problem but they wo n't honor their agreement to pay . They explained that it 's been 2 years since I first reported the problem and that 's why . I 'm very disappointed by BMW Stevens creek for not honoring their agreement . When I tried to discuss the issue , Chris Hansen , the service manager has become unavailable . I 've left many messages and waited for 1 1 / 2 hours while picking up my car but Chris was in meetings . I came home and saw an email from Chris Hansen sent while I was waiting for him in the service lobby . He can send an email but ca n't meet with me while I waited for him ? That does n't seem like BMW service to me . I LOVE my BMW . In the future , I will go out of my way to visit Peter Pan , Fremont , or Mountain View BMW .	0

I did use this glass replacement for a month and it does work , but please consider another option . When you replace the factory glass yourself , you end up removing a film between the digitizer lcd screen and the glass . Without that film the touch screen becomes incredibly less sensitive . Say goodbye to swype or any hope of using the phone while it is warm . The film also helps the phone displace the heat from the processor . My suggestion , If you are going to replace your screen , at least replace the digitizer as well . A digitizer will come with the glass already factory adhered to the digitizer . Or , do like I did , and buy the digitizer with frame and components . With the frame attached there is no heating , broken glass , burned fingers , cut fingers , or chance of improper installation . All I had to do was unscrew 11 screws to move over the back plastic and circuit board . This took me literally 5 minutes and a reboot . Yes the replacement glass and 3 m adhesive is only a few dollars total , and yes it will work , but the screen will be much much less sensitive and dust will gather in between the glass and digitizer .	0

Here is my story .I got it in May , I think , and only last month I was able to go out with it in public . So May , June , July . . .at the end of my period in July I finally figured out what 's the correct position of the cup in me ! ! ! In August I was for the first time able to use it in public and not freak out . In May I only used it at home . Dry runs did n't help cause you not gon na know what is the right way and how it wo n't leak . In JUne I also only used it when I was home , expecially , on my days off , it was nice to see what works and what does n't and monitor the leaks . Here 's some tips on INSTALLATION as I call itthe rotation 360 is not necessary for it to work . Once I put it in I use punch down fold , the fold facing my back side , not too far yet , I stick a finger up each side . . . .this seems to create a seal . Then I push it further . It sits just behind my pubic bone , a bit off center to the right . It will sit in you the way it wants to like many others already said . What was confusing to me at first is that I expected it to open up and right away take this round shape but this is not so in my body . It seems to be sort of weak and bent front and back . . . .so I thought it wo n't work . Also , as I push it up , once I ran my finger on all sides , it bends . . . .this , I thought , is n't gon na work but it works ! I insert it in parallel to the floor , by the way . . . . .with the fold facing back side .But then it does become the proper shape cause when I pull it out hours later it 's fine and round . So do n't be too concerned with the way it feels at first . It took me 1015 min to install it when I was learning , not it takes 5 .I could n't sleep with it cause I thought it would get lost in my . Well , believe me , it wo n't get lost in you . Even in times when I pushed it too far , I was able to fish it out but it takes longer .at first your fingers and hand are gon na be challenged since you are not used to fishing this thing out of there but once you figure it out , it will be easier ! ! ! At first I thought that it was crazy and slippery and all kinds of things ! and freaky ! I was a tampon user with big pads at night double protection on my heavy days . Once , I got to know diva cup , my first successes were nights ! I could sleep all night with just tiny daily pad and then wake up even 10 hours later no problem . If it was heavy , it would start leaking once I got up and went to pee . You gon na have to find your own way to fish it out . When I was learning , I had to check myself every second to see if it 's leaking when I was experimenting at home . Some of the sensation is different . . . .the air will come through and to me it feels like it 's leaking casue that 's what it is like with tampons . . . .once you feel that , you better run to the bathroom . This is not the case with diva cup . . . .it just the way it is .My last period I have n't used a single tampon . This is the trend this time too I am pleasantly surprised and I am still getting used to this thing . Please , do not give up on this because you see how long it takes ? This period I even lost touch briefly . . . . .The first day I couln't get it in properly but then I got a hang of it again .I used to get up in the morning , change a tampon , go get ready etc for work , take shower . . . . .waste a perfectly good tampon cause it was only 2 or so hours before I had to pull it out . . .then put new one in right before leaving . Now the set up has changed . I get up and go about my business . I do empty and reinstall the cup about 30 min before I have to leave so I can see if it 's leaking . Usually , if it 's not installed properly , it will leak within 30 min to an hour . You can tell if you go pee and wipe and there 's pink . But when it 's properly installed , it 's crazy ! ! ! It 's like you have nothing going on , there are no reminders ! No strings to hide or worry about or move out of the way when you pee or properly put it in your underwear so if tampon leaks , it leaks in your daily pad , nothing is pink . . .it 's really crazy . You can take shower and wash yourself like nothing is up , it 's really nice .Before this last period started , I was even thinking that it seems as though I have n't had a period in a while . . . .cup made a difference . On my lighter days I can go for 12 hours without emptying it . Heavy days . . .maybe 4 hours . My advise is to not fiddle with it if it 's not leaking . My middle days I can go for 68 hours without having to mess with it .I now carry couple of individually wrapped flushable wipes in my pocket in case I have to empty the cup . That 's better than carrying tampons around . I never liked having to grab a purse and go to the bathroom , I used to carry couple of tampons with me at all times during my period . Now if I know I have to empty it , I go into handicapped stall with the sink . I either wash my hands or use sanitizer . I advise you to watch some youtube about using and removing diva cup . It helped me . Once I grab the cup , I gently rock it and pull it out . I dump it in the toilet while I am still sitting pulling it out easiest when I sit on a toilet , and I put it in standing up , with my legs spread apart and hips tiltting forward a bit , then carefully wrap toilet paper around it so it does n't drip on my clothes , stick a piece of paper b / w my legs , and wash the cup out , making sure nothing is stuck in those little holes at home I use toothpicks to clear them and unscented soap to wash the cup , then I wipe myself with the wipe and install the cup , then wipe some more . I agree that some of the leaks may have to do with some of the blood being on the path as you are installing the cup . I think with me it helps that I swipe my finger on all sides , that helps get rid of some blood so it does n't leak later .Please , try it . I have yet to travel with just this cup as opposed to loads and loads of tampons and it 's so much easier to live during those days when the only thing you need is inside you I will write more if I think of it later .UPDATE 5 / 1 / 2013 . NOw I manage to wash out this cup in the shower in the morning as I am getting ready That is my wash after the night . That feels so good to be able to do that without any mess . Then I just scrub myself like normal . I do manage now to go about 912 hours with one cup I am not on my natural period now , so it 's lighter than it used to be . I did have to change / wash during lunch before on my natural period esspecially if it 's day 1 or 2 which is pretty nice . This is one of the great things I did for myself in life . Good luck everyone . This is totally worth it . I do still manage to insert it wrong from time to time when it leaks within 12 hours I hate when that happens !	1

Good looking very slim case for Samsung Galaxy S4 . It has a slight tacky feel which keeps from slipping out of one 's dry hand . I like this case much better than Otterbox Commuter which is a tad bulkier and offers a bit more protection . Easy to install and remove when necessary .	1

when i went to go search for a movie in a neighboring city with a zip code i did not know i found it very hard to locate and buy tickets for it . i ended up having to go through google , then regal 's website and then it linked to the fandango website . my complaint is the poor search capabilities of this website and the confusing user interface for the navigation when you do not know all of the specific information about the movie . of course , when you can provide the required info , it works great . i also tried the general searchbar at the bottom of your site and it could nt catch any of my keywords . this is an issue if you want people to stay on your site without getting frustrated with the navigation . i usually go to a site for it to do the searching and question answering for me . they should , in my opinion , make my job easier . this fix seems mostly to involve moving a useful keyword optimized searchbar to the header of the page . thanks !	0
Read Forbes article on the class action law suit against Kia . Kia wo n't honor their warranty . Even after the law suit they are still not honoring their warranty . There are at least 2 Kia Optima 's on their lot right now that have sludge caused by , The problem is that metal debris was nt removed from the engine during manufacturing and that debris can clog oil passages , leading to engine failure . Even when you turn in proof of maintenance they still do n't honor their warranty . They do n't return calls . They do n't keep records . They do n't turn in the records you give them . Buyer Beware .	0
At first I absolutely LOVED this case ! My battery would last all day , with heavy usage . 31 days after purchase , I started noticing my phone would n't charge sometimes even though it was plugged in .What happened was the part where the power cord gets plugged into the phone case fell inside the case so the phone was n't charging . See the image above .I contacted PhoneSuite customer service . They are willing to replace my PhoneSuite Battery Case , if I pay for shipping back to them and pay for shipping back to me . I think that 's horrible customer service ! I do n't recommend this phone case at all ! I love the idea behind it but the product is n't well made , and customer service is terrible .	0
i was really skeptical about the hydrabrush but i had to buy one because i HATE brushing my teeth , and i mean i REALLY hate brushing my teeth . it is by far my most hated chore , even though i was using an oral b sonic complete which is way better than a manual and only takes a little over 2 minutes to get a good cleaning .i just used this for the first time and it was better than i expected . the toothpaste was a little harder to put on , but it sticks to the brush and if you do n't turn on the brush until it 's in your mouth you 'll be fine . you start with it on your FRONT teeth . this is important because you have to bite down on the bristles . once you have this contact established , you turn it on and move it to the back of your mouth . then you have to switch hands and do the same to the other side . i was n't thrilled about using my left nondominant hand , but found it was easy because you do n't have to brush back and forth like other brushes . i brushed over my teeth twice because i did n't believe this thing could possibly get my teeth clean enough . . but they were sparkling ! and it was really fast ! brushing the top and bottom teeth at the same time , with minimal effort and a great cleaning ? you ca n't ask for more than that ! it 's the best brush on the market ! i did have a couple of instances where the brush bumped my teeth , but then i learned to open my mouth wider when brushing the back teeth . it 's really not as hard as it looks , and there 's no pain involved . i 'm excited about using the fast setting , and seeing how fast i can brush my teeth ! ! pros the above . . it comes with a tongue scraper which is good for bad breath , somehow it avoided a lot of the mess i am accustomed to as far as toothpaste getting everywhere . it was VERY clean and selfcontained . it 's also just more FUN to use . and it 's quieter than my oral b sonic complete .cons you ca n't use it in the shower . the replacement brushes are kinda expensive and have no wear indicator .i think the hydrabrush is simpler to use than other brushes . . when you think about it , normal toothbrushing is pretty complicated . this simplifies the process AND gives a better clean to boot . and compared to the price of other electric brushes , THE PRICE IS RIGHT ! ! !	1

Wow , a pair of shoes that come with a DVD ! I laughed myself silly and continued laughing as I watched . Then I wore the shoes for 2 hours and had to take them off , my legs and butt hurt ! I was a Marine and that is the last time I ever ran , but this brought back long repressed memories of that ' good ' running burn . It took me a while to work back up to the 5 K walk with my dog and it 's now a real workout . It 's also very good for your posture , tilts your hips correctly and keeps your feet aligned correctly . I wear out the outside of my heels and I tore my knees up years ago rollerblading , so I know how important it is to keep my feet positioned or suffer bursa pain . No problem with these shoes . I love them ! I bought them with a birthday gift certificate , now I am saving up for my future replacement . I love he fell of a run without running	1
I was trying to lose a few extra pounds that I put on . I bought this product because I heard a lot about Garcinia Combogia helping with weight loss and curbing appetite .

I have a lot of energy throughout my day and my appetite is definitely curbed .	1
I expected far less from the GE100 Blood Glucose System and am delighted to know that right there in a 6 .5 X 9 .5 box is a complete , nothing else needed to take readings for blood glucose and best of all it does not hurt much at all . The box is larger than the actual devices used in creating the readings and , for me , the elements inside the box make a handy , easy to use kit .So far I manage my blood glucose with prescription medication and have not had a need for injections however , it aggravates me to visit a doctor 's office and spend over 20 per pop to get the same results I get from the GE100 for a lot less . Before I forget there is one slight difference in my usage and the instructions contained in the kit . I take my blood sample from the left inside of the end joint of the middle finger of my useless right hand . Some years ago I was told by a plebotimist that blood drawn from that area it can be the inside of any finger does not hurt as much because of fewer nerve endings and the skin is not as worn as the part where a fingerprint is taken . After having donated over 25 gallons of blood I have little reason to doubt a person 's advice on blood drawing and the statement appears to be totally accurate .To be sure that I followed directions and as a way of verifying my comments I visited my doctor for that 20 pop and had a blood glucose panel drawn . The results were identical to those from the GE100 . That was a 20 trip that was well worth the investment for future readings . Now with that behind me I take readings when I believe my blood glucose might be acting weird due to my constant desire for all those wonderful things persons with diabetes should NOT eat . The numbers are generally in line with the rotten feeling from eating those goodies . The GE100 is my sentinal and it sure is nice to have a fall back tool that works well .	1

I like the way the hat looks , except it is not the color it was supposed to be , which rather defeats the purpose , since it will not match with my coat . I ordered dark gray , and the hat I received is more like a purplish gray . . .appearing more purple than gray . Even my husband , who is color blind , could tell it was n't gray ! I hate to give it 1 star based on the color alone , but I think the color matters A LOT ! If you do n't care about the color and do n't mind that it will take weeks to get , you will probably be happy with it . I am writing this more as a warning for those that , like me , might care about the color .	0

The product was very cheaply made . You can tell by how it feels . It does not even feel like a regular HTC cable . It does not charge my device well at all . I bought a few so I could stick one at work and have a few backups but it appears as though they are practically useless . Do n't waste your money .	0
I was in town from Chicago for a marathon when the check engine light on my car came on , and I drove to this dealership to have it checked . Despite not having a scheduled appointment , the service department immediately took my car in for a quick inspection and pinpointed the problem to a faulty EGR valve and coolant delivery pipe within an hour side note I had noticed that my coolant was draining into seemingly nowhere and had experienced other subtle performance issues that other places could n't / would n't explain . When they found out that the repair was going to take about six hours , they gave a loaner car so I could continue with my planned activities for the day . Something else that stood out about this place was that they actually had all the parts they needed in stock this makes a huge difference when you 're in a time crunch . The staff was professional , knowledgable , polite and respectful . In summary , they provided a committed and superb quality service that I would recommend any day . In fact , I travel to Michigan a lot and so whenever possible , I would like to have my scheduled car maintenance done at Sharpe instead of my usual place in Chicago .	1

This product is a perfect example of false reviews to drum up more purchases . Amazon should really check these type of reviews . Note that each review is grammatically perfect and similarly written . Also , if you check under each name , they try to appear legitimate by reviewing other products , BUT the bulk of the products reviewed are on the same dates ! There are some that lazily reviewed 7 products all on the same date . Do n't be duped do your homework and check these reviews carefully .	0
i hate that i had to go all the way through creating an account just to find out that you had no information on any theaters where i could get the 7 . 50 discount to see despicable me 2 . there should be a way immediately to enter zip code and find out if there 's any use in proceeding before i have to give out personal information . it feels very much like a bait and switch . i hate that i ca n't find any way to close that account , since it is of no use to me whatsoever . i hardly ever am able to go to movies ( maybe once in the last 3 years ) and i do n't want to start getting endless emails from someone and having my email address sold to all kinds of other businesses . what i want most of all right now is to cancel this account and erase my information from your data banks .	0

I would love to give ZERO STARS if I could ! ! ! Service from the Service Manager Donna was TERRIBLE ! She is rude , and does not care about her customers ! I purchased my vehicle from another Autonation with a warranty . Sandy simply told me it was my responsibility to figure out what is covered not theirs , and if I do n't like her answer then to take the vehicle to where I purchased it ! So they NEVER even touched the car after it sat with them 2x and over 24 hours each time ! Thanks for wasting my time , and for the horrible service you gave me and my family ! I Will NEVER do any kind of business with them .	0

I have to say the seller is top notch and the shipping was fabulously fast . They are amazing . That being said . . . .The volume on this is low so I checked Motorola forums , now I know it is n't just me . Even my fried Plantronics 925 has better volume . Who cares if the people I call can hear me if I ca n't hear them ? Maybe I got a lemon . . . if so , then there are a host of others , not posting on Amazon reviews , who got the same type of lemon . No lemonade here . Received the unit 6 / 13 / 2011 , paired it at 100 pm EDT 6 / 14 / 2011 and sending it back 6 / 15 / 2011 . Motorola customer support was a wasted call . They wanted me to call the seller ? What ? I explained for the 3rd time I only received it yesterday . There is no firmware update . Maybe they do n't get that in offshore customer service . Please . . . . if I wanted poor service , I 'd call HP or Dell customer service .If you choose to purchase this , I wish you well .	0
I should have checked the reviews before wasting ten bucks on this completely worthless landfill to be . As soon as I set the little system up I realized I could have saved myself some money by going to the hardware store and buying the finest sandpaper they make . With some double sided sticky tape , and that sand paper I could have made this at home in about 30 seconds . Sure it took the hair off my legs but in the sanding process it left my legs all white as if I had just sanded a piece of wood . I could have shaved in half the time it took me to sit there and buff the hair off my legs . Like other reviewers said it does not work at all on anything other than smooth tight skin with course previously shaved hair . Now we have a new 10 toy for our 4 year old .	0
Let me begin this review by first getting this out of the way why ca n't other screen protector manufacturer 's include a micro fiber cloth that is actually larger than the device you use ? Upon opening the package which was packaged very well compared to others you will find not just the included protectors themselves but a very large and very much appreciated large micro fiber cleaning cloth as well as 4 dust / lint remover stickers . Again very happy with everything that was included compared to the bare bones amount that others provide for much more money , you just ca n't beat that . Now that that 's out of the way onto the install watch their instructional video first ! Myself I am very bad when installing these things and after watching iSmooth 's instructional video they provide online via YouTube , I was able to do this in one go . Once installed I would have to rate these very high in terms of overall quality and can say I am very satisfied . No orange peel effect and no image degradation whatsoever . Consider me an iSmooth faithful customer for my other electronic devices from now on .	1

I had high hopes for these leggings alas , they are built for women with saddlebag hips and thighs . I am just not built that way . I have skinny legs and thighs . So , if you do n't need the extra room in the thigh and behind area , do not buy these . If you do , they will probably work very well . But , they also run a little short in my opinion .	0

I guess you get what you pay for .This robe is so pink ! I wanted to wash it right away because I was worried about the color bleeding on furniture if I wore it .I washed it in cold water on the hand wash cycle . It did not go I the dryer . Several seams completely pulled apart . I am actually not certain if it arrived that way or if it happened during the short , hand wash .It is large and does n't fit well . It you wrap it around , the pockets end up in a weird place .Yes , it is inexpensive , but not worth anything .I was hoping for a bit better based on other 's reviews .	0

I have a similar beard trimmer to this that I picked up at Bed Bath Beyond for 45 . I loved the trimmer so much I picked this one up for my vacation house . It was only 23 .45 and the only difference from the more expensive one is it does n't have the stand to keep it on the counter . Its not a big deal because its only in a house I use about 4050 nights a year , max . I do n't know if the 20 is worth the stand , but I guess that s up to you to decide .It trims my beard perfectly and really does n't make a big mess . My wife has even used this to cut my hair before too , and no issues at all .Definitely worth the money .	1

It took awhile to figure out the reason , but the metal strip that runs lengthwise in the razor head and keeps the blade in alignment is .01 thinner than the other razors I have and measured . This is enough that along the length of the blade it can and does sit ever so slightly cocked , leaving a corner sticking out further than it should . I found it impossible to shave without some serious nicks every time , regardless of the brand of blade .In my opinion , the Feather razor is an excellent razor , equal at least to the best of the old Gillette 's I have and for far less money than the Merkur . The Shark razor blades are OK , better than the Russian or Korean blades I have purchased , but nothing to compare to Feather or Derby .	0
This does not work .I see good reviews . But did nt work for me .I do nt know why .Was it too thick , maybe !	0

Some have complained about the magnetic strip placement interfering with their devices operation , but for my motorola bionic , it 's perfect . Others have also mention that with the default attachment the holster could slide sideways and your phone could slip out . I 've not had this problem . I like the quality , the appeal and am recommending this holster to anyone who has a Motorola Droid Bionic and is looking for a quality protective case .	1
I purchased this toothbrush from Amazon .com a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since . This toothbrush comes with a couple of different modes and settings such as gum brushing but to be honest I only use one of them for brushing my teeth . This toothbrush has a few helpful features that I do use . One of the helpful features is the UV cleaner . I have to charge my toothbrush about once a week so whenever I do , I take off the brush and put it in the UV cleaner and let that run through to ensure any bacteria is removed from the brush . I also enjoy the timed alerts that tell you after 30 seconds have passed when you are brushing your teeth so that you can move to a different section of your mouth to brush . While the toothbrush vibrates it 's just a little sound it makes that tells you 30 seconds have passed and the setting I use it does this 4 times .The only problem I have had was about a year and a half after having it , the battery stopped charging or holding a charge . I contacted Sonicare and because the brush was within the 2 year warranty they immediately shipped me out a new toothbrush that I received in a couple of days .Overall I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for a good quality electric toothbrush . I have had it over 2 years and I am very happy with my purchase .	1
Great people to work with . All are understanding and kind .	1

I needed a stand that was not attached to the protective cover , but most stands are made for a device without a cover . The Empire Samsung Galaxy Note mini Folding Stand is perfect for my G3 with the Outerbox cover . Plus I can use in on my I pad if I choose . This is a great little stand that does n't cost allot but has great potential for a variety of products and uses . A plus is how fast it came and the sellers concerns that the purchase and product was a great experience . It certainly was . . .	1
i got these for my daughter for christmas i checked them out they looked like true to size and the color was a nice brown i think she s going to love them . . . . . . . well its been very cold here in las vegas so i gave these boots to my daughter early she loves them she wears a womens 8 i wish they had 1 / 2 sizes these boots are so cozy she does nt neede socks or just waer thin ones	1
I so wanted to love this product . I am a big fan of pomegranate . Unfortunately , I could n't ingest more than two bottles of this formula . I tried , I really did .First , the smell was that artificial , offputting smell you get when you first open a new bottle of cheap herbal supplements .Second , the mixture 's color is for some reason weird to me . It 's too opaque . Almost like a dark purple skim milk ? Hard to describe . And it just never seemed to blend really well no matter how hard I shook the bottle .Third , the taste . I just could n't get past it . I tried thinning out the mixture and it helped a little but it only meant I had to drink more of it to get the full serving . It has a chemical taste to it and a worse aftertaste .But , on the upside , the packaging is gorgeous !	0

i am a deaf person . i do n't get to the movies often as movie theatre owners do n't use closed captioning on the majority of their films . usually , they put it on one b or c rated film and only at one time of the day . this is an insult to a deaf person . they want to enjoy the new movies along with everyone else but , they can not . ca n't something be done on a more regular basis to accommodate a deaf person ? thanks for your time . mark anton	0
i have such a deep and utter hatred for your website . on too many occasions your website times out on us while trying to purchase tickets . the site then goes into a glitch and shortens the time to buy tickets by several minutes every time we go back to try again . our theater has a very limited number of seats and uses a reserved seats only policy . after your website times out on us the seats that we picked are marked as unavailable , even tho we are the ones who attempted to reserve them . i was also very disheartened by the lack of phone numbers to call for help with this matter .	0
The watch looks great . It could take a pounding and keep going . Price is Okay and it got here in good time . It has 5 alarms , hourly chime , and other sounds if only you could hear it . I 'm not kidding that Casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out . You have to have the thing next to your ear to even hear it . I have an old watch which sits on the table about 20 feet from me . I lost the instructions , so now every day at 320 pm the damn thing goes off . Loud and clear for about 2 1 / 2 minutes unless I get my lazy butt up and push a button . Anyway , if you do n't need the alarm , then go for it . The buttons that are hard to push was not a big deal for me .	0

My expectations may have been to high on this robe . It sounded good in print but was n't in reality . To begin with , though I got the XL size , the thing is too small . Oh , it covers , but is not as roomy as other XL robes I 've had . The absorption is also poor . It 's rather flimsy . I bought this to replace a robe I had gotten years ago at GAP that was roomy though the same size as this and dried me off quickly after a shower . Perhaps it was a tough act to follow . This robe didin't come close .	0

I was buying these for my 83y old Dad . I had no idea about this product since I never needed it before . I thought the price was good as Amazon list it as already reduced from 27 to 16 for a pack of 12 , so I trusted I was saving money . . .I found a pack of 32 at Walgreens for 14 .99 . . . . that is about 40c each Vs 1 .40 each for the Tranquility at Amazon .The Walgreens brand is exactly the same . For us that is 36 for a month if I buy at Walgreens , or 127 a month for the Tranquility . . .WOW	0

I thought that twice the amount of tweezers might make the epilator hurt less . No such luck ! Maybe if they created some type of numbing spray or lotion that you could use to lessen the pain would be perfect . If only .All I can say is OUCH ! I had a similar product about 15 years ago and it was terribly painful but I thought for sure by now they would have improved it to be better and less painful . Nope , same awful pain . I could n't even finish one leg because it was so painful . I 'll stick to shaving with a razor , thank you !	0
Fantastic dealership and staff . I actually live in Las Vegas and bought a brand new Kia here from Kia Henderson just in May . And the experience was abysmal . I vowed to never go back . So when my brand new car was totaled by a reckless idiot without insurance only 5 months later I was devastated . I looked around online and saw that Kia of Irvine has 3 2016 Kia 's still at a reasonable price . I called and spoke to Leo in sales and explained my predicament . Leo and later Jean were both very helpful and true to their word . They did what they said they wouldso rare these days , it 's almost a superpower . Five stars ! ! !	1

This may be the perfect 3 / 4 pant . This is not a capri pant in the way women have capri pants . They are looser and shorter than most women 's styles . They have an adjustable waist that will get smaller a few inches from its maximum size by gathering up the waist in the back left and right sides , but not larger . They will look fine on any man . In fact the street wear long shorts that are popular in big cities are longer than these are . For me the problem is I am a true 31 waist and these are made in China , probably by people who do n't get paid to care and be consistent . Within the same color , style and size there can be up to two inches of waist difference between two pair eg . Some size small had at 32 waist and some had a 30 waist Some medium would not go down to a 31 waist . That left me constantly returning and reordering sizes medium and small to finally find the color and quantity I wanted . When it was all said and done , of the pants that fit me some were size small , and some were size medium , but all were about the same fit . That is very poor quality control in a pant that fits with sizing like XS 2327 , S 27'31 , M 3135 , L 3539 , XL 3943 . If you are a waist size in in the middle of a given size range , I would expect these pants would be perfect . If you are on the line between two sizes , I wish you luck and watch the sellers return policy .	0
convenience fee the convenience fee for purchasing 4 tickets is nearly equal to the cost of another ticket ( for a matinee ) at my local theatre . if you are going to charge for this , should n't it be per transaction and not per ticket ? it is n't even worth it to use your service . instead , i am getting in my car and driving to the theatre ahead of time . i will not to use fandango for any movies in the future in my hometown unless this policy changes .	0

I love these covers . Between my wife and I we own 6 of them . 2 for Samsung galaxy S4 and 2 for Samsung galaxy s3 and 2 for HTC Inspire . The price ca n't be beat . I seem to drop my phone all the time and I have never had a broken screen or scratches on my phone . In fact I had my phone in the store one day for some help and the lady said 34do you even use this phone ? 34 I love the slim fit . If you are using stock chargers they fit fine . I have found some after market chargers do n't fit as well . This case stays on very well but easy enough to get off !	1

I am so disappointed in this product . Having happily used the regular GREENER CLEAN sponges in my kitchen and bath , I bought these figuring they 'd be perfect for scouring the tougher jobs after dinner . WRONG ! They are completely ineffective , they do not get anything harder than sauce off a pot , forget about scrubbing baked on foods and sauces . The simple job of cleaning egg off an omelet pan was n't even done to my satisfaction as I found that after plenty of scrubbing , the pieces of egg stuck to the fiber of the sponge half the time and the other half remained stuck on the pan ! I wish I could return these since they were n't cheap , but since I opened the package I can not . I will stick to my good old BrilloBrillo Strip Shine Soap Free Steel Wool Balls , 6 eafor a few dollars a carton . The Scoth Brite name normally is one I trust , and their other Greener Clean sponges are very goodScotchBrite Greener Clean Absorbent Sponges , 2Count , but these missed the mark altogether .	0

I purchased the AquaAudio Cube at the end of April . It worked great until last week . I used it fine with the original charge and then charged it the first time after the battery died and that worked great till it went low the second time . It will not charge at all now .

One of the worst customer service experience ! ! Waiting at the front desk to be served for a while . Finally someone showed up like she was doing favor to me . Showed no interest getting a sale . Was given me a ridiculous price quote compare to what they have been advertising . Did not even had car to test drive . Seems like sale rep are making too much money and do not care about customer walking away . I rather give my business to dealership that hungry .	0

i just had one of the worst online purchase experiences in 30 15 years . i tried to redeem a trialpay ticket and had nothing but trouble . i finaly backed out of the purchase sequence in the hope that my credit card would not be charged as i received no place to print a ticket . the pages for trialpay were no in html format but in ascii plain text . there were no buttons shown for navigation . if you are interested i have a select all copy of the page i could send if you wanted it . in any case i do not plan to ever attempt to use any trialpay programs in the future .	0

a few days ago i sent in a question request for information on a refund or exchange on tickets that were purchased for a showing of a movie i was unable to attend . i recieved an email back that said i could exchange for another showing of another movie , however , there is no way for me o reply to the email in the way i was instructed , so that leads me to believe there was never intent on an exchange and i feel cheated and will never again purchase tickets from fandango .	0

hi , it seems that you have redesigned the movie overview pages . while they do look cleaner and simpler , i like the old pages better for one reason . before you made the change , i could easily see all the versions of the same movie that were released . for example , jack the giant slayer was released in 3 versions regular ( 35 mm ) , 3d and imax 3d . and each version gets its own page on your website . you old design used to list all the versions on the left of the pages , regardless of whether they were available in my area . this information is now missing on your new pages . in the past , i could visit any of the jack the giant slayer pages and see all the versions that have been released . i feel that would make me a more informative movie goer . i hope you will bring this feature back . thank you .	0
are you kidding me ? i sent a customer service question you respond with how was fast furious 6 ? ? once again , i had a family emergency did n't finish watching the film ! i want to see if i can get 4 tickets again , to finish watching the film . please let us finish watch the film .	0
I would highly recommend the Coconut Creek Hyundai to anyone looking for a vehicle . My salesaman Chris Hurst as well as the sales manager Vince were super helpful and knowledgeable .

I am very sure this is not authentic Louis but who will really question you on a phone cover . For 5 you receive a product that appears to be a 500 name brand . Only one , bus pass , one license , and one credit card fit . Cash is not really an option for this minimalist wallet . It is more for the person on the go that wants to carry as little as possible .	1

Bought this last minute for a wedding to smooth out my tummy and back under my dress . Based on the reviews , I thought it would be a lifesaver . Boy was I wrong ! I am 5'5 , 160 lbs and a size 12 , and a Large was WAY too tight . It just would not stay up , rolled down immediately . The rubbery elastic on the inside that is supposed to stick to your skin and hold it up did n't work at all . Returned it immediately .	0

Bought this for my girlfriend because she was always cold . Thought this might be good choice for her . It was beyond expectations , she wears it on a really cold day with only a tshirt under .

This RazberyK really adds something extraordinary to my day .It 's kind of like a feeling of wellbeing and increased energy .I ordered this product not thinking it was going to work but it did , I was n't getting hungry when time for lunch was approaching , so I could wait longer to have lunch and would get satisfied with less food , it also took away the need to have sweets , I was addicted to chocolate candies , but immediately after I started taking RazberiK , my cravings for candies or any sweets subsided and now when I think of it I do n't even mind , I 'm just not interested anymore and they 're sitting there waiting to be eaten .RazberiK works to keep my hunger down , if I work at dieting it will help me lose weight .	1
Finally I CARE ! I am so tired of not caring if I misplace my forearm chronological assistance device but those days are GONE FOREVER ! Let 's cut through the significant hype concerning this item sure , its mindbogglingly expensive but think of the freedom that gives you you will absolutely not leave this watch on the bathroom counter at work you will most certainly offer some other less valuable item like your carto a wouldbe criminal who has n't seen Hollywood 's blatant disregard for the longsuffering time piece industry over and over again in the movies which such frivolities as Here , take my watch to dark alley AND late night Central Park muggers its an outrage ! you will NEVER again cross the New Mexico / Texas boarder , check the time , discover you forgot your watch at the Santa Fe La Quinta and NOT GO BACK FOR IT you are free from all of those things and so much more . I also understand pawn shop owners will offer nearly 25 . . . and that 's 25 you would n't have had if you tried to get ' ready cash ' with a Timex I got 21 .50 for my Timex and the title on my car .Aside from that this watch is perfect for my interest in historiography a word I have waited nearly 17 years to use in a sentenceand with all the dodads and whizbangers on the top its almost as easy to make chronographic investigations as say , my cell phone or maybe the cable box , or the time / temperature sign at the bank .Beyond that its waaaay cooler than my dad 's crummy Zenith T .V . back in the 80 's way cooler .	1

I received it promptly . I was little uncertain at first when I opened the shipping package I saw what it was packaged in , a zip lock bag . I also was hesitant to buy because other reviews stated that it was n't durable . But I figured for the price I 'll give it a try . I would n't lose much if it did n't work out for me and if it did then I got at an awesome price ! I 've had it for three months now and it works great . It is n't as flimsy as people said it is , I do n't see how people could break those prongs . Sturdy and reliable ! I would highly recommend it ! ! !	1

To be fair I got them in the store , not on amazon , but the rolls are individually wrapped and then wrapped in a bigger pack , so the problem appears to be with the product and not how the vendor stored or transported it . Anyhow , when I opened the roll it smelled strange . And when I wiped my wet hands dry they felt sticky . Like there was some filthy residue on the towel that got on my hands . I looked on the wrapper and it said made from domestic and imported materials . Hmmm . It makes me imagine some filthy factory in China . I do n't know where the materials are from , but all I know is wherever makes them has a major quality control problem . It 's pointless to dry my hands with a dirty towel or use a dirty towel to clean up messes .	0
We have n't purchased a new car in over 15 years . I was n't looking forward to dealing with a salesman after stories that I had heard . When I got to the dealership I was set up to talk with Eric . I explained the situation and he explained the possibilities very clearly and I became very comfortable dealing . There was none of the pressure to buy that I was expecting and He gave me a price that I though we could be comfortable with . I went and talked with my wife and came back and purchased the car . Everything went very smoothly . This turn to be a very pleasant experience thanks to Eric . Good job Eric . Wayne and Beverly Fogle	1
Well done 75k miles service . All the work was completed promptly with good explanation of what was done and wnd why . I was offered a nice loaner car . It was a good experience .	1

Nice case at a nice price thin and does n't really add to the phone width , and the magnet keeps case closed , but the back is cheaply made and it broke in 3 places and now wo n't stay on the phone . .	0

The price is right and the quality good , so I will purchase this item again . My doctor said I must take fish oil , so this fits the price point and quality .	1

Overall this is a 5 star for the idea and the execution . I like the idea that music / podcasts and phone calls can be made from this device . It has a good speaker as well as microphones built into it . While driving , it is awesome to have it on your hands so that you can easily hear podcasts . I use it for this purpose . The charging is very unique . There is a clip which you attach it at the right points and voila ! it charges . Very unique .Overall works well for phone calls , audio music / podcasts . For pairing , press B button for around 710 seconds . SomOne e of the improvements I suggest for next version is having a even more brighter display larger fonts also . I would also suggest a bigger font for manual . It was hard for me to read . I just scanned and used the pdf to read easily .The packaging is awesome and very well protected . Overall nice idea and works great for the purpose . The bracelet itself is very sturdy and excellent build quality . I was provided this product in exchange of a honest and fair review .	1

They are cute sandals . . . But when I ordered the 9 / 10 I was confirmed and sent an 11 . The sizes to choose from and click were not in order . Meaning it went 11 , 7 / 8 , 9 / 10 .

The dark chocolate in these bars is very pronounced .The high fiber count 4 g is exceptional for a bar this size .The only downside is that the coating melts if you let the bar get warm . This means that if you live in a place that gets hot in the summer , ordering from amazon will get you a messy result .Luckily , mine arrived when it was still cool and they were delicious whole , and satisfying as a post workout snack .	1

Looking at this case in the promo shots , and also when you first put it on , makes it look really nice . Streamlined , sporty , stylish . Unfortunately the function of the case is pretty bad .My issues There is this really cool patented Belkin ' hinge ' that you adjust the band around , and then undo the hinge and it allows you to put the armband on / off , next time you put it on it will be the same tightness . Which is great , except I found it really easily to get my skin caught in it on my arm . Left me with at least one bruise . Great concept , but could use a bit more work . Phone sits ' below ' the armband . This means it looks good from the top , but the phone is pushing into your arm , including the headphone jack this is annoying . You can also feel the phone itself pressing into your arm . Also because there is a whole for the headphone jack , sweat can also get in there .Other designs that put the iPhone above the band , solve most of these issues , but do n't look as good . I wanted to love this case , but after about 23 miles with it , I ended up taking it off and putting my phone in the pocket instead . Switched back to my cheaper TuneBelt instead and this is n't a great case , but beyond this one .	0

I 'm really disappointed in this product . This product has zero potency . The capsules sure look real , but I suspect they 're a complete fake . Curiously , this product is also marketed under a different name 34resveratrol premium34 . Same threebottle package , same company , same address . I bought that one , too . Also a dud . I also wrote a bad review for that product , too .I also bought resveratrol from a reputable brand rhymes with wow . That supplement has an amazing boost in my energy and metabolism when dosed with freshground black pepper . Do a web search for piperine .Unfortunately , there are a lot of shady products sold on Amazon . Stick with a brand you trust . Do n't get tricked by products promoted as less expensive .	0
Few homeopathic products work as well as Arnica and for a wide variety of applications . My wife has been dealing with chemo therapy and lost her hair several times over the last 3 years . Her scalp tingles and actually hurts at times the Arnica soothes the scalp and makes the process more manageable . We use it on scars or after any type of skin surgery it speeds the healing process and greatly reduces scarring . A recent benefit I 've found is that daily application to vericose or spider veins results in wonderful clearing on the skin . A truly remarkable product .	1
I bought this from someone NIB some time ago and have been using it for two cycles , and I 'm not yet impressed .I've heard it takes a few months / cycles to learn your cycle , and some of the reviews I 've seen on here are making me very concerned that I wasted my money on this .IMO it should not have to learn my cycles . It should be reading if my LH and estrogen are increasing or not , no matter where in my cycle I am . I do n't like that it automatically gives you two Peaks in a row . I do n't like the fact that it may read my levels incorrectly and cause me to be off on when my O date is . I might as well use OPKs and hope my husband and I have sex at the appropriate time to conceive .I like the six hour window three hours before and three hours after I hit the button . I like its ease of use .However I feel that this will only cause more stress on someone who is TTC and has health issues regarding it PCOS .I will give it ONE MORE cycle . After that , its going up for sale to someone who wants to give it a shot .	0

This item is SMALL . It is snug on an adult and is better suited to a child , but they do n't mention that ! In any case , I find the fivestar ratings COMPLETELY unbelievable for the same reason ! The bicycle rider ? when you ride , your head is tilted back exposing the neck , because this is small , tilting your head back will STILL expose your neck ! ! The other fivestar rating are SUSPICIOUSLY vague , almost like the SELLER wrote them ! ! In any case , SIX in one ? Not a chance , as a hood and neck warmer , fine . But as a cap / beanie ? ! BULL ! ! ! and there are no instructions / photos on how to do this that SHOW / PROVE it can be done !

I bought this just to try it out on my son 's new iPod Touch 5 , and his Sony docking station . He has a very sleek rubber case on the iPod . This device ca n't even plug in with two very thin 2 mm thick rubber strips near the lightning port . He has to peel back his case to mount it on the Sony docking station . All it would have taken on Apple 's part would be to extend the little lightning plug another 35 mm and I bet most of these problems would n't exist . The bottom line is , if your case wraps around the bottom of your device and comes within 10 mm of either side of the lightning port . . .you're hosed .What makes it worse is charging 29 for crap .	0

This case did n't fit . I sent it back for a refund and initially got a credit . But then the credit got reversed . I ca n't send it back again because I do n't have it . Terrible buy .

a feature i wish this app had is the ability to change and arrange the order of theaters in the my theaters list , the way bookmarks , email folders , etc . can be ordered on the iphone . the only way to do this now is to remove each theater from the list , and then add them back , one at a time , in reverse order , which is extremely tedious .	0
I would never buy anything from this dealership . I would nt trust them to air up my tires . I left this place and purchased a Maverick X3 from another dealer and it was like night and day .

These shoes feel like you are wearing a cheap pair of canvas tennis shoes . No support what so ever . I wore them to go walking and wound up limping home .

I like the looks of the Bolse AON4 10000mAh ! I 'd define it as a power bank with a tasteful amount of bling . The front has a mirrored finish , with a chrome look on / off button . The tasteful bling is completed with a 5 / 16 chrome look band around the perimeter of the bank LED status indicators that are encircled with blue light . . .very pretty . Although this is one of the fanciest power banks I 've seen , my 24 yr old soninlaw said he would n't hesitate using it . He does n't think it looks feminine .Before first use , fully charge the AON4 power bank using the included AC adapter . It 's recommended to completely charge the AON4 every four months to prolong the power bank 's life span .Now for what 's really important . . .like all Bolse power banks I 've used , this one performs great charges my Kindle Fire HD , IPod Touch , LG Cosmos phone my other devices . I need to use the included USB spring power wire with the micromini USB connector when I charge my phone .

Six sizes of laptop connectors , labeled A , B , C , D , G , H , are included with the AON4 . To charge your 9V or 12V device , use the included DC power cable , the laptop connector that corresponds with your device , press the on / off button , slide the voltage selector to the appropriate output voltage either 9V or 12V and begin charging . I was n't able to test this featureIt 's important to unplug the power cable promptly when the device is fully charged .The Bolse AON4 10000mAh battery pack comes with an AC adapter , USB spring power cable , DC power cable , travel pouch , 6 laptop connectors , an instruction manual 10 mobile phone connectors to see the included connectors , hover your cursor over Amazon 's image at the top of this page .

Bought this battery for the shear size and capacity . At first the battery was amazing and preformed well , then a few days later when i plug my charging cable in it makes a high pitched sound and get annoying rather quickly .Then the battery stopped working all together , now it wo nt charge any phone even with the cables provided .It connects and then quickly disconnects and shuts off .This is a big let down being that i needed a battery of this size due to my busy work schedule .	0

When I initially bought this , I thought I just had a defective unit that required too much pressure to connect my Note 2 .Although the micro USB is defective because of the pressure required , forget that .This charger is complete and utter trash .Why ? Because it impedes the amperage , resulting in many fewer milliamps reaching the phone , thus resulting in a much , MUCH slower charging time . And that 's with the original Samsung charger that came with the Note 2 hooked up to this dock .Most of the reviewers here have no clue that this is the case . But it is . Want proof ? It 's easy . Download a charging measurement app , such as Galaxy Charging Current , from the Play Store . Connect the charger that came with your Note 2 . You 'll see that you 're getting between 1700 and 1800 mA 1 .7 to 1 .8 amps . That 's what you should get . Now connect the charger to this dock , and put the Note 2 in the dock . You 'll suddenly see you 're getting about 460 mA or so .460 mA is what you 'll get if you just connect your Note 2 to your PC via USB cable .This is simply a worthless piece of plastic . The manufacturer deserves to go out of business for foisting this junk off on Note 2 users .UPDATE June 7 , 2013I contacted the manufacturer , having been outside of the 30 day Amazon return window when I discovered the problem with the amperage . Support very promptly replied and told me that they 've never heard of this problem , and that I should try another AC charger this , of course , despite the fact that the charger worked just fine when connected directly to the Note 2 . So I tried it with my wife 's S4 charger the same model Samsung 2 .0 amp charger and had the same problem . I emailed Support again and told them as much . No prompt reply this time . No reply yet at all , in fact .Don't be a fool who thinks just because this still allows charging , it actually works well . It most certainly does not .UPDATE July 11 , 2013After emailing Support again , they responded and apologized , and promptly sent me a new unit . This one actually works more or less and has no defective micro USB connection . The problem is that the charger supplied with the unit only provides 1 .5 amps something I did n't even notice with the first unit I assumed it was a 2 .0 amp charger . That means even with a nondefective charging dock , the Note 2 will only draw about 1 .3 amps , instead of the 1 .7 it could draw were it connected to a 2 .0 amp charger . This is certainly better than the less than 0 .5 amps I was getting with the defective dock , and it may ultimately not make much of a practical difference to most people , but it 's still more than worth noting . Also worth noting is the fact that there ARE defective docks being shipped by RND , so if you have what seems like either a defective micro USB connection or a longer charging time than normal or both , it 's not you . It 's RND . Return it .UPDATE July 2014I've been meaning to update this review for a while . The replacement unit simply up and died about six months ago . Meaning I had no more than six months use out of it , even with its relatively limited charging capacity . The charging cable still works with other wall chargers , etc . , but the unit itself is as dead as a doornail . And inexplicably so .Buyer , do beware .	0
Walked in to their facility , was not attended to accordingly , lady at the front desk was not knowledge in what she was talking about , gave me false information was changing her story around several times and was n't sure on what she was talking about , then proceded to get a mechanic , and he was well seemed as if he did not want to help me , starting making excuses saying there were other things that caused my car the issues it had saying I crashed my car when that was not the case very very very poor experience I will never return to this place and I HIGHLY RECCLMEND NO ONE TO COME HERE ! ! !	0

With empty binders , some supplies and a lunch sack comprising the entire contents , one strap started fraying at the top of the pack by first period . By the end of the day , the other strap had ripped completely off ! ! ! We were surprised because it seemed very sturdy , and it 's really big , so it can hold a lot . But it did n't even have 10 pounds of stuff in it . My other teen has n't used his yet for school , so it is n't ruined yet , but we 're sending it back as well .Really , do NOT waste your money on this pack . I have never seen such poor quality on almost ANY product that I have ever bought . Absolute JUNK .	0
I love these sleek undies . They fit perfectly , they do n't ride up , somehow . And they are totally cute . I love the silky fabric , too .	1
I have two wheelchairs and these covers will not fit either one of them . They are at least 4 inches too narrow to wrap around the arms of the wheelchair . As far as comfort or padding goes , there is none . Look somewhere else for your armrest covers , good luck .	0
This is my first smartphone so I did not have any previous experiences with other screen protectors .I did some research , looked at what was offered on Amazon , read the reviews and decided to go with amFilm for my new iPhone 5 . It was the right choice ! This is a quality product . It fits precisely , you can not even tell its there .Installation was not a problem , just take your time and follow the directions .What makes this screen protector stand out from the rest is their customer service . I emailed them with a question to which I received a prompt response . Plus , they followed up to make sure I was 100 satisfied .	1
Oil ChangeI came for a oil change . the first guy that I spoke to told me the price and also advised me to wait for about 510 min and an advisor will speak to me . after 40 min I asked a differed person why no one has reached to me and all cars are in the shop but mine is still out here . he did n't know . he helped me with getting the car into the shop but when I asked for the price he gave me 80 increase compare to the first guy . after telling him that that 's not the correct price he managed to get the right price . waited for about 1 . 5 Hr . and the car was done . the 40 min wait for my car to get picked up was way too long , also the different price I got its also something that is really concerning and make me think if I overpaid .	0
Dalton was great ! While he was not there for the final purchase as we failed to call to ensure he would be there . He helped us during our research phase and sold us on the car we purchased . During this research we mentioned the month of the year we planned on purchasing , Dalton called within the first couple days to follow up and see if he could assist with anything . Awesome salesman , not pushy , very happy with our experience with him !	1

Exceptional Car Buying ExperienceThien Nguyen was extremely helpful and quick ! I walked in knowing what I wanted and left VERY shortly after . This is my second car through him .

It is very important that you distinguish between the Sales department and the Service and Parts departmentThe sales department is very good because everything is clear and predictable including the prices . However , it is a completely different situation for the service and parts departmentThey are not straight forward , so Pay attention ! Check your car very well before you give it to them for service !	0

I will be using it when I get people to sign for purchases when using a Square Reader .	1

Ok , I have had many nose trimmers in the past . When my last one gave out , I did alot of research on the internet before buying a replacement . I decided to give this one a try based on the reviews many websites , including Amazon , gave it . I especially liked the fact that its made in USA . The unit does indeed look wellbuilt . Its all metal ! It will last you a lifetime , no doubt about that . The problems is , it really does not work as you might think it will . First , its very difficult to manauver it . It is quite awkward since you have to use both hands and make the just the right amount of twists and turns just to get to the hair . When you finally manage to cut hair , you will notice that it simply does nt cut it close enough . That is a big problem for me because I had better results with my Panasonic nose hair trimmer that was much easier to use too . The whole point of a hair trimmer is to cut hair to where its not noticable ! I m sure other electric trimmers will give you better results as well . Also , you need a screw driver just to open it up to clean it ! It has grease on the blades , so all the hairs get stuck to it . You have to wipe off the grease and apply more if you have any . Please , do nt buy into the hype of if being Made in USA . Those words simply do nt mean anything anymore . Do yourself a favor and buy any of the Panasonic ones .	0

If you are looking for women 's panties and are tired of going to stores and not finding them in your size then come to Amazon and they will have them .

cheap and very uglyI rarely write a poor review , but I guess you do get what you pay for . . .this scarf was very inexpensive , but poorly made , bad sewing and just unwearable .I ordered Lavender and finally I got something terrible purple I dot know i recognized the scarf by the flower , I was so disappointed I wanted to return but it will cost twice from my country , so my advise is do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0

I just bought a BMW from another dealer and took it there for them to check it out and perform a warranty service . I made an appointment for 1 pm and got there on time . It took awhile for the service person to come out and then he made a list of what needed to be checked I got a loaner and asked if I could get the package out of my front seat as I needed to mail it . The valet said he would be right back , after twenty minutes I was late and left , without the package . I called the service person at 11 am the next day , expecting the oil change to be done and asked what was going on with my car , service person said he would check and get back to you in a minute two hours later I texted again , only to be told they had not even started it and I was last in line . Then he said it would most likely be tomorrow Saturday before they could get to me . Seriously , two whole days for an oil change a a check through ? IS there a reason I was not told this to begin with ? Is there a reason he could not get back to me ? Is there a reason I had to constantly ask HIM what was going on ? Was there an apology ? Was there anything ? No , there was not . I will NEVER go here again my experience , this is NOT what a luxury dealer visit should be like . I had an Infinity for years and I was always treated well there this , this is a joke . NO wonder they have the lowest score on Google of any BMW dealership here . WORSE Customer service EVER !	0

I 've tried three different cases on my Nexus 5 and this screen protector peels up around the edges with any one of them for the price of this you 'd have though they would have cut back the screen protector a little from the edges to accommodate a case protecting the face of the phone is only one part of a total solution .My advice purchase a CHEAP adhesive based screen protector that actually fits and stays in place and just replace it when it becomes unusable which this screen protector will also become rather severely scratched from having to try to push it back down under the edges of the case so often .OBVIOUSLY no one at this company really uses their products , or they 'd have corrected this rather significant issue long ago .	0
They cornered me while my car was being serviced and talked my wife and I into trading it in . Made a lot of promises and made a lot of statements that just were n't true . I found out they were a crew that was only here a week . Turns out they hire these crews now that tell you anything you want to hear and leave and there 's no accountability . Also they were paying the remaining balance on the trade in . It 's been 20 days and they still have n't done so . Now I am late on my payment for a car I do n't even have . I am getting different stories as to the pay off . Not happy .	0

Honestly , I expected a lot more since the name Seidio is pretty well known , my wife has had a few for her iPhone so I assumed this would be as good or if not better . I got the case in a box with no wrapping or product covering besided the box and inserts . Wow so you spend 30 on a name brand case that s what you get ? I could nt get the kickstand open and my wife wanted watch a movie and almost broke a nail trying to get it open . I guess with my wife 's iPhone case was a great experience but I will be going back for an Otterbox case this time and pay the extra money .	0
Though car buying can often be a stress filled experience where the customer feels they are battling the dealer my experience with Rosen in Madison was exactly the opposite . I actually felt like everyone was truly looking out for my best interests . There was no pushing for extras just what we wanted and needed . Of course , I realize they are a business and work for a profit , but I did not feel like we were pressured or being gouged . Every aspect of the new car experience was low pressure and very much like dealing with your next door neighbors . I purchased my Pathfinder in another state and have been going here for service before the new owners took over . I can clearly say they have integrity .	1

I purchased this because I could n't find the Zagg HD Invisible Shield on Amazon Prime and this had good / decent reviews .Oh , what a crap this product is ! Installing this screen protector is frustrating and laborious as getting all the air bubbles out was impossible for me . And , using the provided squeegee and microfiber cloth actually scratched up the screen protector really bad .What an epic fail of a product . When it comes to this product , 34Made in Korea34 means nothing as it is no better than 34Made in China34 screen protectors .I'm gon na return this and just buy the Zagg product from its website .	0

I was expecting something different , maybe that 's where I went wrong . It 's basically a flimsy piece of material with a handle . Wanted more of a duffle / gym bag and not something that 's not sturdy and rugged . . .it 's a shower curtain with a handle . If you 're looking for something protective , shop elsewhere . This is basically a piece of thin piece of vinyl or whatever with a zipper and handle . Would n't buy again . It may work for some people and some purposes . Overall grade D . . . .but if you use it as a shower cap to wrap around your head , it may have alternative uses . . . . Not sure where these others reviews come but suspect some are buying their own bags and then reviewing tooting their own horn and the owner likely trolls these reviews thumbing down any negative comment that realistically reflects the poor quality of the product .

I generally do not write bad reviews . However , this product was extremely disappointing . Despite the silicone pad on the heel , the liner slips off after you 've walked a few steps . The serged edge is rather thick and digs painfully into the foot , leaving a red mark , despite the fact that the liner length seems true to size or even a trifle large I mostly wear a 88 .5 / 39 shoe . They also show with flats and heeled shoes , I 'm not talking the minimal ones that show toe cleavage , but sensible walking flats and mediumheeled pumps . One star is because the fabric itself is substantial and seems sturdy . Money wasted and I 'm now off to try another brand .	0

This device is an excellent concept . It 's makes taking pictures and videos from an IPhone easier . That it does . What it does not do is provide a practical way of doing so . To leave the device on the IPhone is cumbersome and awkward . To carry it around is useless . Most photos / videos I use my phone for are not staged . They are spontaneous and to have to pull this out , stick it on my phone and THEN take the shot is too much work and most likely I 've missed what I wanted to capture anyway .Add in the fact that a specific application is manditory .Now add in the suggested retail price .Not worth at least not for me .	0
This would be my 4th pair of Asics . I always order a 7 .5 and know that it will fit . . . . . until now . This shoe fit extremely small in every way .

The Ice Maiden black is a keeper . I 'm usually a size 7 .5 / 8 and though these boots in size 8 were a tad too roomy , they were worth keeping because all its other features make it worth wearing . They 're stylish , have a tongue so that you can tuck in pants , and are comfortable to walk in . They 're not clunky like most other snow boots . I have n't worn them in the snow yet , so I ca n't say if they stay dry even after the snow melts on the boot , or if they 're waterproof sometimes melted snow seeps in through the seams of winter boots . so I 'll find out when I wear them out .	1

I was surprised by the quality of this ring given the retail price . The stainless is so smooth , rounded , and polished on the inside that it easily slips on my finger and feels comfortable . The outer part of the band has a finely textured surface that gives it a dull sparkle . It 's difficult to describe how that surface looks since it is reminiscent of super fine sandpaper but is only barely rough it sparkles but not like gems . I ca n't tell if the sparkle was applied or is uniquely textured stainless . The band itself is wide , about 1 / 4 inch , and it looks like a unisex wedding band except , of course , for the sparkle finish , which looks feminine . The thickness is also substantial , making the ring feel and look more expensive than it is . Note I received a sample for review .	1
These leggings are very short inseam . Not made for bending over in , and not good for a short shirt . The material is okay , better than other leggings that I have but the shape of the leggings ruins the pants all together . They could be made of the highest quality cotton and because the cut is funny they 're not wearable . I set them back , and was refunded promptly and efficiently . Seller very nice .	0
if i want to find all theaters showing a particular movie it is not possible with your new web site . the old site had a button that when ckicked would show all the theraters and their show times for a particular movie . please fix it .	0
the last couple of weeks i can never go to my theaters even though it shows me logged in . i try to buy tickets and i get errors saying i need to log in which i do or get errors it still only allows me to proceed as guest my friend had same issues and decided to just buy tickets at the theater from now on your site was great before , but boy you screwed it up bad in a short amount of time ! a shame !	0
There are two things that make a good BT headset technology and anatomy . Technology is relatively easy to assess , unfortunately we all have slightly different anatomy so everyone is going to have a slightly different result . Aside from comfort , different earpieces will line up differently with different ears and this will effect sound quality . I 've had headsets that sounded crappy unless I held them in an unnatural position they would not rest in on their own . My review is based upon my experience , take it for what 's good and bad but you need to evaluate on your own to be sure .On to the Icon . . . .Technology It charges quickly and will last an entire busy day , I have n't verified the actual amount of talk time , but in mixed use it 's fine for me and I average around 2500 minutes a month on my cell . It 's small and light , not nearly as obvious looking as the original Jawbone , the only flashing light faces inward and is only visible when you 're not wearing it a Pro to me , I do n't need to look more obvious . It will pair with up to 8 devices and automatically connect to the first two it finds on power up . I carry a personal and a work phone , I have not been able to get it to accept calls on both at the same time , but the work around is actually not bad for me . I have it paired to both and I just turn BT on / off on the phones when I need to switch . It connects quickly and reliably . A2DP I installed it but I turned it off , I 'm not looking to use it for music , but it 's nice to know I could . Noise Assassin I guess this is the big selling point and honestly , it works for me . I was completely unimpressed with the original Jawbone , but the Icon actually works . I 've left myself voicemail driving 70 mph with all the windows down and then with the radio playing too loud to hold a normal conversation with the windows down and I could still understand what I was saying in the message . Subjectively , everyone ekse says it sounds great on the other end . Changeable voice prompts nice touch , but for me it 's not a make or break option .Anatomy Subjective Fits securely for me . This is the first headset that I have n't needed to use a loop on . It wo n't fall out of my ear from chewing gum or yawning like some others have mentioned , chances are your mileage may vary . The fit lines up with my ear well so that sound quality on my end is very good . Oddly enough though while on calls the audio is perfect volume for me and audible in most noisey conditions , but the audio prompts and notification sounds are lower volume and hard to hear sometimes . In certain noisy situations I 'll hear or feel the phone itself before i hear the headset . Maybe I missed a volume control in the Aliph MyTalk but I like the unit enough that I 'll deal with it . Does n't hurt to wear it , but it makes my ear sensitive / sore . I do n't notice it while wearing it , but after a while if I touch it , I 'll notice it 's sore , and after I remove it touching my ear is uncomfortable , but oddly it does n't get uncomfortable that I have to remove it . I 'm really hoping this gets better with time as I really like this unit and I 'm not ready to call it quits .ConclusionFor me it 's the best sounding , comfortable when my ear is not sore headset I 've used to date . I recommend trying it for yourself .	1

We went in looking for a new car , but our salesman would only show us a specific used car . The car did NOT have a sticker on it , and he stated he would not give us a price unless we test drove it . He told us to look it up online . We were n't really interested in a used vehicle , and when we asked to see specific new models , we were told the keys were n't available . He did show us one more car that was a base model that did not meet our criteria . The salesman quipped We like people to actually drive our cars . We went back to our car and sat for a few minutes in disbelief . The only explanation I could think of was that they prejudged us . We were dressed kind of bummy , but perfectly acceptable for a Saturday morning . Coming off a vacation , I had n't shaved in a while . I guess we did n't fit the cookiecutter definition of their idea of a customer . BIG mistake . This salesman identified himself as the manager of internet sales . If you are reading this Sir , perhaps you should remain in your office behind a computer instead of dealing with live customers . You are losing sales for your employer . By the way , the last time my wife bought a car , she did so without test driving it . While he was playing all of these games with us , he was doing it with a trainee watching . Guess that 's just how it 's done at Kia of Greenville . Avoid the frustration and go somewhere else .	0

AILET was kind enough to send me a case for review .The first impression was that the case fits so snugly and perfectly on the iPhone that it feels as though it should have been part of the base design . Because of its transparency , it allows the basic appearance of the iPhone to shine through without dulling or making it look 34ugly34 as some other cases tend to do . It feels like a more durable version of the bumper that Apple used to give away due to 34Antennagate34 .There are coverstyle pieces for the buttons , including the power and volume buttons , and a cutout for the speakers and charging port on the bottom . The speaker cutout was not perfectly aligned with the speaker holes , but the charging hole was lined up nicely .At first , pressing the power button seemed to be a bit more challenging because it forces you to press the button squarely in the middle . Most longterm iPhone users are accustomed to being able to press either side of the button to get it turn on it 's easy to press so you can quickly get to what you need . The power button cover on the AILET case does not allow for this , and it takes some getting used to . In some ways this is a positive design it prevents you from accidentally pressing the button when you did n't intend to , powering on the screen and draining the battery unnecessarily .There were two nitpicks observed . First , the edge of the case where it was apparently sealed feels sharp to the touch not to the point of cutting , but it 's apparent when holding the device for calls . If you 're a leftie , it 's a plus it helps you hold the phone as it rests comfortably in your thumb . If you 're a rightie , it 'll be slightly annoying as it will rest in your finger joint and possibly get uncomfortable after a lengthy phone call .Second was that the phone is not matte or patterned , which means it was prone to slipping out of the hand slightly easier than the phone without the case . Again , if you 're a leftie , this likely wo n't be an issue .If you 're trying to get something that protects the edges of your device and is raised enough to help protect the front and back of an otherwise fragile device , BUT is not unattractive and retains the appearance of the iPhone , consider this case .	1
These sunglasses do n't even look like real sunglasses when you get them . They look like toys or costume props . I ordered two pair from the same seller , I returned them both the next day .They're strangelooking also because they are completely flat across the front . It looks like there 's a curve in the photo but that 's an illusion . If I want cheap sunglasses I 'll stick to local stores .	0

In the summer I tend to wear flip flops most of the time . While my feet love it for a while eventually they end up callused and my heels tend to crack which is quite painful . I received one of these foot baths and started using it partway through the summer before my heels got too bad . This helped keep my feet in great shape this summer and prevent the damage that I 've come to expect with summer . Plus working a job where I 'm on my feet a lot , I tend to have soreness fairly often . This is a great refresher at the end of a long day and this is great for relaxing too ! The way it drains is excellent too . The foot bath my mom had when I was a kid had no type of drainage and had to be dumped out . This Helen of Troy one has easy drainage to prevent dumping foot water all over yourself just when you 've gotten relaxed .	1

First of all , I 'm 64 years old and have never used HRT have been using NOW Indole3carbinol for several months with great success in overcoming symptoms of Estrogen Dominance bloating , water retention , insomnia . Tried this Calcium DGlucarate after reading that it aids in ridding the body of xenoestrogens and took it along with the I3C . I started out with 2 tablets per day 1000 mgs with no apparent results , then went up to 4 tablets . Symptoms returned with water weight gain , a very bloated belly and trouble staying asleep . I discontinued use and within a couple of days those problems were gone . Indole3carbinol and DIM enhance 34good34 estrogen production , while getting rid of the harmful ones . Think in my case the Calcium Dglucarate got rid of the good stuff and left me with symptoms of too little estrogen , which are a lot like estrogen dominance . I base my onestar rating solely on my experience with this product . It may work just fine for others .	0

I 've had bad acne ever since I started sixth grade , I 'm currently almost 21 . It was never little zits , but pimples . Over the years it went through waves of better , worse , better , worse . I 've tried everything in the book to get rid of it .After years of torturing my face with heavy chemical acne creams , like Proactiv ew , Clean and Clear not so bad , and other stuff with names I ca n't pronounce , I turned to using much more natural , organic face washes , with the occasional Clean and Clear cream for when it gets out of hand . It 's worked wonderful for me , but it mostly kept my acne tamed , and not getting rid of it .I've heard a lot of good things about tea tree oil , and I finally decided to try it . This is all MY PERSONAL experience , as I obviously can not promise anything for OTHERS , except to give the results of my experience using it .I dip the bud end of a QTip into the oil , get a nice amount on there not soaking but enough where I wo n't have to redip the QTip , as I do n't want to add in the bacteria on my face into the oil . I then simply dab it on the spots after washing my face or rinsing with water and pat drying . Then I 'm done . I use this as a simple spot treatment . I dab on , I do n't rub . I use one side of the QTip for one side of my face , the other for the other side . I usually put this on after I have used a moisturizer , before bed . Also if I am staying home for the day , I moisturize and dab when I wake up .I did n't see an immediate difference or improvement , but after a couple days I did notice that the acne and redness went down quite a bit . I continued , and a couple weeks later , one side of my face with the least acne has nearly gone away , and the other side the one with the most acne also looks quite better , too . I am not sure if I did n't see a big difference the first few days because my acne was bigger and more irritated , and now I see more of a difference because there is less of it . Or because it just took a few days to work , but either way I will definitely continue to use this .I love the smell of the oil , it is potent and smells amazing to me , but not to worry as the smell wo n't stay on your skin . I leaves my skin feeling slightly minty , which I also like as I feel refreshed .	1

I would give them zero stars if I could . Our experience has been terrible . The carpet in our Equinox was coming up so they had to order a replacement . A few weeks later , we called to check on it and we were told that the carpet had been there for a while , but no one had called to schedule the service to replace it ! After several calls up there where we were told that someone would call us back that same day and several days later we FINALLY get the service scheduled . We were told that it would take a few hours and we would need to leave the car . Well , we dropped off the car at 815 , and called back up there around 300 to check on the progress . We were told that the car would not be ready until the next morning additional parts had to be ordered . So we waited . Around 100 the next day we had n't received a call , so we call to check on it again . We were told that our car was ready ! ! ! FINALLY ! ! ! To our disbelief , the service representative informed us that the carpet the one we waited weeks for was n't even replaced ! ! ! ! They did n't need to replace it and just needed to properly attach the carpet with rivets . So we go to pick up the car , and my husband hears a whistling sound coming from the driver 's side window . He goes to roll the window down and the window comes off the track ! ! ! ! So we had to take it back up to the service department . We were told that a part had broken in door that was keeping the window in place . We were also told by the service representative that this was a part that NEVER breaks . So my question is , how did it break ? ? ? It worked perfectly fine before we brought it into your shop . Someone was not being attentive and cautious with the property that was entrusted to you . Now we have to take the car back in . Not to mention we were supposed to take this car out of town on a family vacation . Needless to say , we will not be bringing our car back up to your service department . We will drive across the state to find better service than this if we have to . Also , I do n't appreciate being transferred a dozen times before someone can answer my questions and concerns . Your company puts the term customer service to shame .	0

I just got this . I bought it based on the ten positive customer reviews . First of all , this is tiny . It is about the size if a roll of coins . It runs on one AA battery , which , thankfully , three are provided . Also provided are suntan goggles which you will need the first time because the light is extremely powerful and you are trying to figure out how to use this . Do you just hold the light in one spot ? For how long ? How close to the skin ? The answers are in the small pamphlet including the warning NOT to point the light towards open eyes .Does it work ? I just got it . I think so . I have extremely painful ankle PTTD , posterior Tibial tendon disorder . I rubbed the extremely intense red light around the pained area and the pain eased . It works by heating the blood and getting the blood flowing .The brochure clearly states that it is for TEMPORARY RELIEF . I only gave this three stars because I just got it , because it is an expensive way for temp relief and because it is obvious of the high dollar markup on the gadget . If I could have a doover , I 'd buy the 45 unit that pops up when you query this up on Amazon . I have a hunch it is the exact same thing for 1 / 4 of the price .I will write an update review when I 've had more experience with it . I like it so far even though I 'm disappointed in the dollar markup . The gadget 's website sells it in installments and for 187 .NEXT DAY UPDATE I just noticed that there are about four reviews all posted on April 20 and one by a doctor posted the next day . How odd is that ? Those comments are also posted on the product 's website . Mine is an honest review . You will get temporary relief and sometimes you have to pay 200 for it but does n't 45 sound better ? I may just buy the 45 one to give you two honest reviews .I do worry that my chiropractor is going to reprimand me because she prefers ice to heat . After using this for one day on my ankles and knees , my bad knee started to regularly clunk . I 've stopped using it on the knee and went back to ice .It has worked well for temporary relief of my ankle PTTD .I will review again after a couple of weeks .JAN 2012 UPDATEI reached for this device the other day to give it another try . I really threw my money , big money , away on this gadget .I stand by my review . It is a DON'T BUY .The intensity of the light from that first day out of the box , has NEVER returned . It 's practically just a small flashlight with a red glow .Don't buy . Especially at any price over 50 .	0
From the very first text I noticed these salesmen here have no appreciate for the customer . They were lazy and did n't want to help me at all . I told them I 'm a cash buyer from out of state and I 'm ready to make a deal . The biggest issue was that I drove far from out of state for a GS430 and they did NOT disclose the car had hail damage . They told me they have 120 years of experience and they have 6 dealerships alone on one block yet no one inspected this used car and disclosed the damage to me before I drove 6 hours to see the car . Then they did n't help me out at all on the already high price for a car from 2004 . As soon as it came to price talk they instantly flipped the switch and started acting extremely rude and disrespectful . I think it was very unprofessional for this dealership to not disclose obvious damage and try to trick me into buying it without a proper inspection . Why should I as the buyer be doing the employee 's job ? ! They are the ones that should have noted the problems with the car , not me ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHADY dealership . Everyone at the used car lot is disrespectful , rude , and unfair especially Dominic ! Do yourself a favor and buy a used car only from a private party !	0

These clothlike wipes do not disintegrate in your sewer pipes or in the municipal sewage system . After some years of use , they clogged my sewer main , causing a backup that required multiple passes of a main line snake to remove . The wipes were entangled on the snake and had to be unwound and cut off , a tedious , disgusting job that took hours . The wipes get snagged on roots or other obstructions in the line , and can remain there for years .I recently read a quote from a plumber about theseA plumber must have invented wet wipes NONE of them dissolve and most of my business is from them ! I suggest you do not use ANY wet wipes or if you do , throw them in the trash . ONLY human waste and toilet paper should be put down the toilet .	0

This is not a dealer this is a zoo . At first my car was more than ten minutes running with the AC on waiting for the first person available to take care of it and the window of the driver side was down , I told about this to the advisor Raul and he told me that in brief someone gon na take care of my care . I tried to reach the service manager but they leave me waiting , over than that after ask me for my name and keep me in hold the advisor was advised that my intentions to speak with the person in charge and he came to see me to ask me if everything was ok and also asked for the reason why I tried to reach the manager . This is one of the worst dealers in this city and advise to others not to go there . It 's also a dirty place see attached photos .	0

This razor is built solid . I love the feel of it in my hand and I like that it actually has weight to it . I use the feather DE blades broken in half . I also bought a Mr . C . so I can use the longer Feather Artist Club Super blades and that is my main razor now , but I use this when I want a quick shave 20 mins with this vs 45 mins with the Mr . C . Only thing I noticed is that you have to dry it completely after use , as I have used it about 8 times so far and I see at least one small rust spot in the area where the blade sits . Other than that , it 's nearly unbeatable for the price and will be my main razor during my frequent travels .	1

If you 're moving to New Hampshire , I do recommend using Sprint for cell service .I've been a customer of Sprint 's for 13 years and received a threatening letter from them , today , telling me that , all of sudden I am using too many roaming minutes on our two phones . I checked the phones and saw that , as I thought , data roaming was not turned on . I called Sprint and was told that although data roaming on iPhones may be turned off , it still uses data roaming and that you have to turn ALL roaming off . Seriously ? ! We live in the woods and I need my phone . The problem is n't with too much voice roaming , just data , but I ca n't use voice , either ? ! Nonsense ! This is a problem between Sprint and Apple , not me . Sprint sold me the phones , Sprint sold the plan at this address , and now Sprint is mad because we 're using the phones .Screw them , they can go ahead and drop me , I 'll go to one of their competitors who are doing a better job than they are , in terms of coverage , anyway .	0

1 . This case is BARELY small enough to fit in the Hyperion charging cradle / docking stationhttp // www .amazon .com / gp / product / B00FZWP1WK2 . Very high quality , grips well . With that said , the Spigen Neo Hybrid is a notch above it in terms of fit and finish but you have to take it off to put the phone into a cradlehttp // www .amazon .com / gp / product / B00DCIZKPMBottom line if you do n't want to remove the case when you dock , this case might work . It wo n't fit all cradles / docks , but it fits the one I have .FWIW , I 'm sticking with the Spigen Neo Hybrid . It feels better , looks better and I think it 's marginally more protective . I do n't dock very often , so I do n't mind taking the cover off when the need arises .	1
I went here on Saturday July 15th to look at a preowned certified Mazda 3 , I got paired with Marty . Who seemed more interested in drinking his iced coffee than making a sale . I looked at the car and noticed that there was some scratches on the front and back bumper , I asked if it was used as a rental car he replied that it was a lease trade in . CARFAX report confirmed that I was indeed correct it was a rental car bought at auction . During the test drive I was asking about the warranty and he did n't know if the car was certified or not he also did n't give me a lot of information about the car . When I asked him how long he 's worked for Mazda he told me 5 years . I would have hoped that Marty would have taken the time to print out the specs about the car so when asked questions he could give me an answer instead of I do n't know . When it came down to how much the car would cost he did n't negotiate a deal except for knocking off 250 from the price . When I asked for a breakdown of the costs he told me that it would cost 995 for a pre delivery inspection which is a fluff considering that the car being Mazda certified is that it has to go through an 160 point check and any parts below 50 wear and tear needs to be replaced . When I mentioned this to Marty he just gave me a blank look . I was willing to make a deal today Monday in cash if the price was right . I politely left but I called June the woman who directed me to Marty to voice my concerns . I left a voicemail Saturday at 5 giving the date and time of my call and did n't get a response till 3 on Monday granted I know they 're closed on Sunday when I voiced my concerns she said she was n't going to make excuses for Marty 's behavior , but between his behavior and not getting a reasonable prompt response when I left a voicemail it was apparent that they do n't need my business .	0

This thing does not fit the Digital D2 934 Pad tablet as advertised . Once you slide the tablet into the leather pocket / frame you quickly find that the tablet has loads of room to slip around inside . This slipping allows the case to cover the camera lens , nearly cover the entire power button on the tablet 's side and is a general nuisance . This is just part of an overall poor experience with the Digital D2 934 Pad sold elsewhere on Amazon .	0

This is the ORIGINAL Rayovac PS3 Universal Smart Battery Charger which I first reviewed more than two years ago . Unfortunately , Rayovac has discontinued this excellent charger around end of 2009 , and replaced it with an inferiorRayovac PS3D Universal Battery Chargerjust remember ' D ' stands for Dumb . So now the original Rayovac Universal Charger is getting difficult to find which explains the increase in price .Original Review followsI already have at least half a dozen smart chargers in the house , including topoftheline models such as theLa Crosse BC900and Maha C9000 , but I still wanted thisRayovac Universal Battery Charger PS3for the following reasons1 . It can accept C , D , and 9V batteries in additional to the standard AA and AAA cells .2 . It can handle rechargeable alkaline cells in addition to the standard NiMH or NiCd cells .3 . It has the potential to recharge up to 8 AA or AAA cells at once .So far , I 'm very satisfied with this charger . Of course it is bulky and heavy . But that 's to be expected for an unit that can accept four Dcells at the same time . For home use the size and weight is not an issue at all .I'm happy to report that this charger is a lot smarter than I previously imagined . Unlike a typical dumb charger in this price range for example theEnergizer CHFCV Overnight Family Charger , the PS3 has four independent charging channels . That means I am free to charge different cell in any channel . Each channel comes with a status indicator LED , which goes out once the cell is fully charged . But most of all , this charger is smart enough to recognize the difference between NiMH cells and alkaline cell , and can pick the correct charging method accordingly .When an unknown cell is inserted into the PS3 , the charger first starts off with a trickle current 800mA peak current at 10 duty cycle , or an average current of 80mA . Based on the voltage profile of this cell , the PS3 can determine whether this is an alkaline cell , or a NiMH cell . After two minutes , the duty cycle is increased to 60 , so the average current is now around 480mA . For a NiMH cell , charging will continue until a negative dV / dt is detected , in which case it switches back to trickle current again . But for an alkaline cell , charging current will gradually decrease with higher terminal voltage until it reached 1 .65V .The Rayovac PS3 is designed to recharge the Rayovac ' Renewal ' brand of rechargeable alkaline cells which are now discontinued . The user manual warned against charging ordinary disposable alkaline cells , but I experimented with it anyway . Initially I observed good results in reviving a lot of spent alkaline AA and D cells . But my happiness was shortlived , because after a few weeks , some of those cells started leaking electrolyte . I was lucky that the leaks were discovered early , and they only caused minor damages to some cheaper appliances . My conclusion is that it is not worth the risk to recharge disposable alkaline cells . You have been warned ! Back to the charger itself , I do have a complaint about its claim of recharge up to 8 AA or AAA batteries . It turns out that each of the four charging channels can accept one to two AA or AAA cells , but the two cells are electrically connected in parallel . So in case somebody accidentally placed two cells of different battery chemistries NiCd , NiMH , or alkaline in the same channel , the one with lower voltage will discharge the other one . The charger may also get confused and fail to terminate correctly in such case . It is safer and faster to charge only one AA or AAA cells in each channel .Update on Nov 19 , 2012I'm surprised to see this old Rayovac PS3 still available through some Amazon vendors at outrageous prices . This product was a great charger 45 years ago . But now you can get more advanced chargers for less . For example , consider theTenergy TN190 4Channel AA / AAA / C / D / 9V NiMH Charger . The TN190 added a REFRESH function and a LCD battery status display . It is able to work from 100240V AC , and can handle highercapacity batteries over 3000mAh .	1

I do n't often write reviews or rave , but I could not be more pleased with this product . I have a tough beard and a fairly sensitive face I frequently experience razor drag and burn . I use the Eton College shaving cream with a boar bristle brush just a tiny dab each morning and feel the razor glide easily . The cream has a nice , fresh , inoffensive scent not cloying or lingering . I 'll try some of the other Bond Street products , but this one will be hard to top .	1

I guess I get no response from owner , figures . Horrible used car experience bought a car with 7k miles on it for over 40k to think it 'd last me awhile to only have nothing but problems with it . Had transmission and clutch issues from the beginning . 2nd day it came out of gear and rolled into a structure and costed 8k in damage . Then get it back from body shop after over a month just to have the clutch fail on the highway a few days later that 's going to be over 3k in repairs now . Only put 1 , 500 miles on it total since I owned it . Of course no help from dealer because it 's a clutch . Last vehicle I ever buy from any Lexus dealership . Horrible customer service ! So clutch was replaced now there is transmission issues . So much for pre certified .	0

My first reaction was that the material is thinner than others I 've installed . But then I noticed that this actually helped it stay on better . The last protector was thicker and the cell case would snag causing the protector to come loose .You need to make sure the glass surface is completely clean before applying . I 'd use a quality screen cleaner and compressed air can to clean . It helps to make notes about the areas that are having issues with the old protector and be sure to clean those areas very well .	1
I 've been to Irvine BMW for the same issue 4 times over the past year and they 've essentially shrugged their shoulders all four times . After the fourth visit , I actually received an email request for a survey , which I took . One of the questions asked me if I 'd like to be contacted about any issues , to which I responded yes . It 's 5 months later and no one has called . And if that was n't bad enough , concurrently with the survey a customer service manager also sent an email asking me to not only fill out the survey , but also reach out to her directly with any questions or concerns . Well I did so by return email some weeks later . Here I am months later with no response to that email , whether by email , phone , or otherwise . I 'd like to believe that this is just a series of mistakes , but the cumulative effect over the past year has left a terrible taste in my mouth , and it 's difficult to envision buying another BMW based on this particular experience .	0

I am disappointed to have to write this review . I purchased a CPO certified preowned BMW in 2015 . CPO vehicles must pass a rigorous inspection and be in great condition , with no previous body work or airbag deployments . Fast forward to the fall of 2017 now . I am trying to sell my car , and I 've been having a hard time doing so . I decided to purchase a CarFax to see what 's scaring buyers away . It looks like the first owner , when the vehicle was a lease , was in a collision and the airbags deployed . That means that this car should never have been sold as a CPO . It also means that I can not sell this car , or trade it in . I have been working with BMW of North America , who have been decent , but I would caution against using this dealer , as it appears they are deceptive and do n't disclose previous damages to their CPO cars . It 's a shame , as well , as I 've had 5 different BMW models over the last 9 years .	0

Nice cover and holster . The material is thick enough to give the feeling of solid protection . The twopart cover , I was not sure about in the beginning , but now I love it . Makes it very easy to put it on or take it off if I need . Actually makes more sense than the single piece covers . I like the fact that the cover goes all around the edges and curls over the front to give maximum protection , unlike the ones where the top and the bottom areas are totally exposed . Love the kickstand , although it does seem to be the one flimsy part in the whole cover . Just have to be extra careful with it , I suppose . But it does let me put my phone sideways and use it as a nightclock with extralarge display at night while still charging the phone . I am using the NightMode app for it . The holster material is almost as thick , and the clip hinge is actually thicker , so hopefully it will last a long time . Overall , easy to slide the cover into holster and also to take it out as well .	1

Nicely made shoe . My normal size was way too small . The forefoot was also too curved for my foot . I returned them and kept the GT1000 which were true to size and fit my foot shape better . They have great heel support .	1
This watch meets all my needs attractive easy to see time , day , and date at a glance illuminated hands for viewing in poor light or in the dark no need to replace battery nice looking as a dress watch if you switch the band to black leather it 's fairy thin and is lightweight . The band that comes with the watch is nice . Had I not needed a dress watch , I would have kept the band it came with . WARNING The manufacturer gives explicit instructions that you should follow . Do n't even try to set the day and date until the watch is FULLY charged . I hate manuals , but this manual means what it says . All will go smoothly if you follow instructions . I LOVE the watch .	1

I did n't read the views because this case was like 46 cents .

Back in the last week of June I damaged my MOTOROLA ELECTRIFY 4 G . I knew that U S CELLULAR was getting the iphone 5 , or most recently released iphone at that time . Was told it would be the iphone 5 , so I purchased the LUNATIK TAKTIK Extreme for the iphone 5 . I did not open the package until last week , September 13 , 2013 . At which time I compared it to one my friend had ordered from LUNATIK . My case has LUNATIK painted on the upper right side on the screen side . The window / Camera opening on top of the display screen is shaped differently . I researched and found several people had ran into the same issues . According to AMAZON 'S return policy I am not eligible for a return . I am hoping someone will read this and realize my delima . I have been very satisfied with all my recent purchases from AMAZON . I would hate for this to be cause of me to stop shopping with AMAZON . My EMAIL is JRDILDA2HOTMAIL .COM , I would greatly appreciate a reply .THANKS , JOHNNY	0

Went in to by a new dirt bike for our son . 3600 bike plus taxes which is what we had budgeted . After we go through all of the paper work , financing approval , spent over 2 hours in the shop , right at the end the guy finalizing the deal made us aware of the 1000 extra for delivery fee , having it sent to the shop from the manufacturer . Pretty slimy sales approach with no transparency .	0

The case fits my s3 and makes it look really cool but makes my phone sticky and dirty . Also the case on the inside gets dirty real fast . The case seems to be made out of cheap material cause I washed my phone case than dried it and put it on my phone and an hour later some of the material inside the case melted on the power button of my phone and it got stuck and my phone would n't turn . I had to clean all that stuff off my power button and take out the battery and clean a bit of the inside before the phone would even turn on . Totally makes your phone different but not worth it . There are better ceases under 5 like the gameboy . Iv'e bought other cheap ceases under 5 and they work a million times better than this one .	0
My husband is usually skeptical of my novelty kitchen items . He approves of this one . Kids LOVE these straws for water , chocolate milk , milkshakes , and smoothies . They seems to rinse clean quite well if you get to them quickly enough and do n't let stuff dry on them . I love that the kids ca n't bite and squish the ends . I have n't had the need to run them through the dishwasher , but if I ever do , I figure I 'll buy a mesh cup like people use for pencils and office supplies , and stand them up in the cup . This might even make it to my Christmas list to other relatives with kids .	1
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCEWent in over 2 weeks ago to leave a 2017 Lexus RX . They transferred a car from another dealership . Went in to pick it up when the salesman called to say it was ready . From then on , it has been a NIGHTMARE dealing with this dealership . Finance manager had me wait over an hour until his printer was operable . Called the GM for assistance . To date never heard from him . There was a refund due to me since I traded in a car waited 9 days together my refund . Today , after 2 weeks , I called to see where the proper registration and license plate sticker was person told me that she JUST received the paperwork and she will process it this week . DEFINATELY , go to any other Lexus dealership before this one ! ! ! ! JUST A MESS !	0

I love food . LOVE IT . I was n't hoping for a miracle , but at this high price point I was hoping for something . Anything . Other than the mildly chocolate flavor , I do n't think these do much for me . First , they look like chocolate , but they are really gritty in texture . Imagine play dough with grit and cocoa flavor . The instructions say you need water to wash it down , to keep from choking . Well , I had no problem there , but the water helped me get the sand . . .er . . .grit out of my mouth . Then , they I tried one at first , the next day I took two instead had ZERO effect on my hunger . None . I recently reviewed Slimfast drinks . They had a noticeable effect on my appetite . Not huge , but noticeable . I 'd not buy these or recommend them .	0

This place has the worst customer service . Had plans to see a SUV last Friday . 4 people called me that morning . That was a little to much . Drove an hour there spent 45 minutes with Larry . Asked him where the car was . His reply was it 's out back I will bring it up . Then his manager came out and tried to get me into another car . After 10 minutes he finally said he sold the car last night . 4 people called me including Larry and no one could tell me they sold the car .

this is cheaply made so I guess that is why it is 10 . Not really worth that . It is thin and flimsy . The velcro that keeps it on is uncomfortable . The gel pack is very hard to get into the mask and only stays cool for a few minutes . The lavender scent packs that came with for sinus relief are so strong scented I had the pack on my night stand in my bedroom and it was completely closed yet the entire room smelled strongly of the scent . It did not help my sinus and I have a migraine today and the gel pack did not help at all . Do n't waste your money on this item . It is also poorly sized as far as the shape of the mask . It 's not even good enough for just a plain sleep mask .	0

I have been using electric razors for about 37 years . I 've owned many in that time , some great , a couple terrible . I have mainly used Norelco shavers because they seemed to work best . I 've tried Remington , Schick , and bought 2 Brauns in the past , both of which were returned because they did not provide an adequate shave . Well , Braun has really improved their product .This shaver is very ergonomic . It is well balanced and works very well when the head is held perpendicular to the skin . Others have commented on the noise this razor makes . I think it might make a small bit more noise than my Norelco , but I think the reason is that the motor in the razor seems very powerful . You can feel the power of the motor as soon as you turn it on . It cuts very well , does not irritate my skin , the trimmer extends far enough to be useful in every situation you might want to use it , and the razor is easy to clean . The only deficiencies I have noted are that the battery charge lasts only about a week and no case is included with the razor . Hardly deal breakers .Anyway , this is a great electric razor and I believe it is the best in its price class . I do n't think you can go wrong purchasing this product .	1

I am a big skeptic and i have been reading about the magnet bracelets every since they came out . . . I thought to myself How in the world can a magnet help with my ailments I am 42 yrs old , i think i m pretty active and i try to live a pretty healthy lifestyle . . i eat right and excercise every single day , but i suffer with lower back pain . I stumbled across MSM which really seemed to help me with the daily pain that i experienced . . . but i had to take it every single day . . . the first thing that i would do is roll out of bed and take a tablespoon of MSM mixed in water THEN brush my teeth and so forth . . . that s how dependent i was on MSM . . .First lets talk about how quickly i received the bracelet . . . that was awesome in itself . packaging was nice as well .My son tried to take it from me as it is a nice piece of jewelry , you would never think that it is a medicine bracelet . I wore the bracelet maybe the first two days and did nt really tell anything different , that second night i accidentally fell asleep with it on that next morning . . . i FORGOT to take my MSM as i did not experience any back pain that night . . . . so i started sleepin with it on and each morning i jump out of bed with no pain . . . also it seems to help my sleep pattern this could be that i do nt have the back pain anymoreI love the bracelet . . . i jus wish they had them big enough for my ankles so that i can have a matching set	1

It seemed a little weird . . Salonpas . I ve heard about it all over friends , internet ads , Shaq even promoted it unofficially . Is it a gimic or does it work ? Well 11 .xx for a box of 120 why not .The strips are two per green plastic divider . Each is 3 '' x 1 1 / 2 '' ? It smells like bengay and sticky like patches i get from my back doctor . Backsurgery at L5s1 and it causes pain all over .So i was reframing my door and had some issues . These arrived just in time and i slapped 4 on . It does nt say on the box how many to use at once but website says ' 2 per spot , 4 at a time ' . Ok no problem . I got 4 on areas of my back that were outta control and after about 40 minutes it actually helped .First a cool wave , than warm , and than eventually the muscle stopped spazzing and the other pains melted away . I like it because the ' icy hot / ben gay ' smell is nt NEARLY as strong as putting on the cream . Its also not nearly as messy like the creams or other stuff .Only downside is if you put these on and go to work and sweat they will come off after a while .Its hard to tel how long the menthol and camphor feeling the warm and cool feeling lasted for .Over all 120 patches . . i d say a good deal .Another reviewer was saying something about a different color box and being better .I went to the website and this is itCamphor 1 .2 . . . . .Topical AnalgesicMenthol 5 .7 . . . . .Topical AnalgesicMethyl Salicylate 6 .3 . . . . .Topical AnalgesThe blue box version he talked aboutMenthol 3 . . . . .Topical analgesicMethyl salicylate 10 NSAID . . . . .Topical analgesicnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugThe Methly Salicylate is what is in aspercreme . I ve used aspercreme and do nt find it very effective . I like bengay and or icy hot because the hot / cool feeling on the skin creates a distraction ' for your brain .Either way give these guys a try . I see a Pain Mgmt Specialist doctor and have been for 8 years and he said alot of his patients like this stuff . He did suggest this as a good addition to medications .Cheers .Hope this helped .	1

I live out of United States7000 miles away . Returning the pants is not worth waiting all this time , which could take weeks to replace .Reviewers only liked the fabric but have not commented on the sizes .I urger and advise every one not to order these pants . They do not realy reflect the actual size .I had to taken them to the Taylor for alteration , which will cost me again 8 alteration for each pant .I'm very upset . . . ! ! ! If amazon have read this messagee , they should do somthing about it , either to contact the sellarand alert them of this problem or Amazon should stop supplying these pants until this problem is resolved .	0

This place is a total scammers paradise where management is in on it . Chelsea Sold me an 750 defective helmet and knew it . When I sincerely asked her for help she did nothing and could n't care less . As a wounded combat vet my bank treats me really well . I called them and i am disputing the charge so they reversed it . Jerks wo n't get their money ever . Ca n't believe there are people out there like LB BMW Motorcycles blatantly ripping folks off and getting away with it . And its not even the cost of the helmet its how precise and on cue they were with their excuses . Bh told me to even call the manufacture and if the manufacture told them it was okay then they 'd do , knowing damn well that when i called the guy at Schuberth he laughed and said She said that , to call me and i 'm supposed to call them , to let them know its okay to help you . Wow , I 've never heard that one before . Me wither buddy . These guys giving 5 start reviews must be family and friends because since this has happened i have told people in the know and they say they stay away from this store and would rather drive into LA for their stuff then potentially be ripped of by these scums . Live and Learn . But in the end i was able to get my money back and want to call and rub it in to the Big Red over there but her low IQ , she would n't understand . I So ill wait till their books do n't ad up then laugh . HEY LB BMW , You ca nt rip of everyone .	0

Took in my truck for warranty work to exhaust manifoldls , bolts broke off . I was told that the original bolts were defective and would be replaced with the correct type of bolt . But they only replaced bolts on one side knowing it is a matter of time for the defective bolts on the other side to fail . They also did a software update due to a safty recall on the truck after wich my headlights do not function properly . . . Now they want 120 just to look at my truck . It does not inspire confidence when all they can tell you is its not our fault . All i expected was the courtesy of them rechecking the work they did to my truck . How ever i am sure they would give me my money back after they found out they made a mistake on my vehicle . . . . not .	0

I am getting my 2011 Mini Countryman serviced today . . . but not by Mini of Bedford . . . my gripe with them . . . about 6 months ago , I had brought my Mini in for them to check an engine light . 45 minutes later , they came out to inform me that my Mini had lots of issues and began to inform me of the following need new Turbo 3500 , need new Timing Chain 2800 , need new air / heater blower unit 600 and finally need rear brakes . Their salesman was right behind letting me know that they would be willing to trade in my car for 4000 . hmmm . . . I told them , I would be getting a 2nd opinion and left . I took the car to a local mechanic , recommended by a friend . The mechanic deals with foreign cars and has been in the business for 40 years . By describing all of the symptoms , he stated that I did n't any of the repairs as stated by Mini . I did need a replace thermostat and solenoid . The cost was a little bit north of 800 few hundred for the parts and balance for labor due to the location of the parts to be replaced . The blower motor issue was a rock the six of a pea stone that was stuck , took maybe 30 seconds to fix at no charge . The brakes were only 80 worn and 6 months later , I am finally having them replaced . I simply do not trust Mini of Bedford and will never deal with them in the future . My recommendation , if your vehicle is out of warranty , find a reputable mechanic you can trust and think twice before using a dealership for repairs . Hmmm . . . spending 800 instead of 6900 makes you really wonder about dealerships . BTW , since spending the 800 on the repair work , the Mini has operated flawlessly . . . If I could , I would share the written quote of repairs for the 6900 as provided by them . . .	0

John was an excellent Salesman . He answered my many questions and found exactly what I needed . His sense of humor made the process go quickly and he was patient enough to stay until all of the paperwork was finished . Matt saw that I got the best deal financially and had no problem staying until 10 pm to close the deal . From the girls at the front desk to the Saleswoman next to John that let me use her phone charger , I felt very comfortable at Rosen Nissan . I look forward to future purchases with Rosen and LOVE my Rogue !	1

I used the earphones with my iPhone 4 and they worked well for the first few calls . After that , the quality was abysmal . I heard lots of crackling and the people that I spoke with also could hear the background noise . Additionally , I found the silver pieces on the earphones to be awkward and did not help with fitting the earbuds in the ear . Needless to say , I am returning my earphones and am glad that Amazon has such a good return policy .	0
I travel and need one to take with me , as I am prone to forget to bring it back , and can not afford to be without one .	1
First of all , these reviews are unbelievable . Every one a 5star ? Second , I feel stupid for not looking at the photo closer and being swayed by these fake sounding reviews because for some reason , I thought it was pills like I 've been taking . This is a roll on . It is a very tiny bottle with a rollon ball smaller than a regular marble . You can not get much gel on your muscle with such a tiny roll on and takes a long time to get a thorough coating of this on . I ca n't tell half the time if anything is actually coming out of the bottle .And most important , it feels like nothing , there is no change , nothing . No difference , nothing . I might as well be rolling water on myself . How can these other reviewers think this is so great when I feel zero change ? ? Added later I used it up and found another major complaint . You ca n't tell when the bottle is empty . The label wraps all the way around the glass , so you ca n't see if you have half left or a quarter left or anything left at all . My husband finally figured out it was empty by staring at the bottom of the bottle under a light and said he did n't see any liquid moving . It did n't last very long at all . The bottle is the size of a tube of lipstick .	0

formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor	0
Being a single parent , working over 60 hours a week takes a lot of energy ! I have gotten hooked on high calorie coffee drinks , and noticed I have been gaining weight . I started using these and the GOAL Matrix Amino Blend powder , and been able to lower my caffeine intake start getting the weight off .The serving size for this one is three pills , I have been taking just one and had great results ! It gives me energy without jitters , and I am not drinking six cups of coffee with cream , sugar , and chocolate in it helllllloooo high calories ! I liked what I was reading about it before I bought it , since I always do research before taking anything . I know that Cinnamon has been proven to help curb appetites , while helping your body get the bad stuff out . These have no added sugar which is good b / c if they added sugar it would be much higher calories . Garcinia has been proven to help block fat ! As the bottle says , and as I prefer doing always do your research and ask a doctor before taking .	1
This formula is a higher concentration of product than what many others sell . Only way to make it better is to put more in the bottle and lower the price . Stop the hype on Dr . OZ he does not endorse any certain brand and this is not a miracle weight loss pill . It simple helps , when use in combination with other select supplements to suppress hunger which aids in weight loss . If you still eat like a pig , you will still look like one rather you take this or not .	1
i never got the product , it 's pretty disappointing cause i was realy looking forward to getting this case cause it 's really cute . but , oh well . they refunded me which is all that matters i guess	0
I must say I had high expectations about this cellphone case due to the positive reviews I read . It took a while for me to take the decision and I regret it .But I must be honest in saying that form a 100 I am 20 satisfied .First the good It looks strong and protective . The reinforced corners look good because you the weak points of the Galaxy S3 are in the corners . The color looks good . Overall the look is great both photos and have it in hand .The bad The case is extremely hard , really hard , I never thought it was so hard . Do n't get me wrong , it might be good but its extremely rough . I had a very difficult time making my S3 could enter with fear damage the phone . When I tried to get the phone out it was even harder . I almost crack my smartphone and it cost me even more to make the phone work .The bottom part of the case where you connect the smartphone to charge you has a sharp edge which makes it very uncomfortable to have it on hand .The access to the power and volume buttons is quite complicated , requiring much strength to use cause it does n't make the fit with the buttons .I do not know if the manufacturer 's intention is to make it that hard or rigid , but it is much more uncomfortable than protective .I probably got the part of production that comes with the margin of error , I do not know . But I 'm 80 or more regretted regards this purchase .	0
This plug started out working well but after about a week of use , the side micro usb power plug snapped off INTO the casing rendering it toast . cheaply made AVOID . It 's going back today since I am within 30 days .	0
i 've used this product on every phone since my first blackberry had a cracked screen . Not a scratch since , and I 'm not gentle on my cell phones . My wife , daughter and nanny all use them too . Put it on , forget about it . You 'll be glad you did . UPDATE 2 months later , I had occasion to test the lifetime warranty to replace a scratched protector , which happened by dropping the phone onto cement . The screen is fine , the protector is damaged exactly what it 's supposed to do . So far so good .When looking into how to use the lifetime warranty , the website mentions that if it was purchased from Amazon , there is only a 30 warranty , everything must be returned in its original packaging with proof of payment , yada , yada , yada you know the drill .Realistically , I would forget about the lifetime warranty	1

These little speakers rock ! For the size and the price , you can not go wrong . I love them . I use them at work and I bought one for my wife 's car as she does not have Bluetooth . She can now take hands free phone calls and listen to Pandora , etc . in her car without having to spend a lot more money on a new car or a new car stereo . They are great and the case they come in is nice to keep it protected in a bag backpack , purse , etc . for travel . If you do n't have Bluetooth , they come with a wire to accommodate older iPods , etc .	1

the webmaster really , really needs to hear this one . when i go to this page https www . fandango . com transaction ticketing amc seatpicker . aspx which is the seating chart bat amc esplanade 14 theatre , there 's a real problem that needs to be addressed . if a person just happens to click on a seat to reserve it but does n't go all the way through to checkout , the seats are permanently taken as if someone did purchase them . this is really bad because if people do this and i wanted to see all the available seats , well your interface is not telling me which ones are actually taken . it shows all the ones that have been clicked on . i 'm a webmaster myself and know how to remedy this and so does your webmaster too . please fix this huge error on this site please . . . thnaks ray groschen	0

You can research this on Google or Yahoo and you will find that the stem of the pineapple is where this comes from . Since we can not eat that part of the fruit the capsules is the next best thing . My accupuncturist highly recommend this procedure is the one who turned me onto this product . It has been used for years to aid in the recovery from surgeries . It has antiinflammatory properties that naturally reduce and quell inflammation in the body . It helps with sinusitis and after 5 sinus surgeries , this is a much better alternative . It also helps with osteoarthritis in the knee . It should be purchased with at least 2400 gdu at 500 mg to work properly . Take 1 capsule on an empty stomach is best . And it is not that hard to swallow at all . Keep taking it daily for best results , this is better than being prescribed prednisone or other drugs with advserse side effect .	1
This dealer is sendding letters saying that they need your car and that they have a special Tradeup program , also that the managers are authorized to terminate your loan or lease , no matter what you owe ! IT 'S ALL A BIG LIE . I went with my little baby , I was there for 2 hours and I lost my time , that letter its a hook to get you to the dealer . I m done with Nissan , I m getting a Toyota or any other car , there are lots of options out there that deserve your money , my time is gold .	0
I have been taking niacin on and off for years . It dramatically reduces your cholesterol , and has many other benefits . However , this product caused a severe reaction which forced me to discontinue use . I am use to the flushes you get with niacin in fact , it 's not a big deal once you get use to them . I also know that if you make the mistake of taking niacin on an empty stomach , you will be sorry more dramatic flush , horrible stomach ache . This product however gave me the worst flush I have ever had to top that off , I fainted in the bathroom and my wife said I was convulsing in what looked like a seizure neither have ever happened to me before , or after taking this Niacin .So , while this is a great value , do n't let that be how you make your decision on purchasing something like this . I contacted the manufacturer , who took basic information down and offered a refund . However , I asked if they would like these sent back for analysis , and they said it was unnecessary . Seems to me someone fainting and possibly having a seizure is a good reason to analyze the product . I 'm holding on to these for further review , in the meantime , I would be cautious taking these .	0
paul , your website leads you to believe that your order goes out on a certain date that you can track the order . neither are true . i asked for a refund on dec . 17 , 2012 still do not have it . i re purchased an email voucher the same day i cancelled the card . i have spoken to several customer service employees and still no refund . i was lied to . my money has been held on to . even after i spent more money with your company . improvement take the deceiving information off your ordering site . remove the tracking lie and finally re visit what true customer service is . i have worked in that field for 34 years . what i experienced with your company is customer harassment . status jan 5 , 2013 no refund . 3 5 business days has turned into 20 some . i have emails as evidence to your company keeping my money . travesty . j cook	0

All these 5 star reviews are by the 34hurrr durr nostalgia34 crowd .I'm 24 so obviously I grew up with the disposable razors we have now . I decided to try this after hearing how they give the best shave and what not .It 's the EXACT same damn shave plus you a lot of cut and blood loss . No matter how careful you try to be , you will cut yourself with this . This razor will take you 1015 min to shave , when a disposable will do the job in 25 min .Stick to the disposable razors . Anyone who recommends this is legit DUMB .It 's like saying having manual windows on a car is better than power windows . Both do the exact same job , but one is more convenient .	0
Would avoid this place . Wife and i went here to look at motorcycles . Wer found two we liked . A harley and an indian . Both on the expensive side . After over a half hour watching the salesman talk to his friend and ignore another customer besides us he finally graced us with his presence . We got in one question until he looked at his phone said we are closing in five minutes . Proceded to answer a text and walked off leaving us standing .	0

I hate cleaning the shower and I admit it do n't get cleaned unless it really needs it and I use a guys only shower so you know what I am talking about . When its time to get it clean this makes it a breeze , just run the hot water get the shower totally wet spray this on everywhere and let sit for 5 minutes . I then use a Casabella everywhere bristle brush with a curved end and just wipe down the walls like running a paint roller down them , rinse and watch an amazing amount of dirt get washed away and just like that the shower looks brand new total time from start to finish maybe 1015 minutes . I get about 34 uses easily out of a bottle cleaning a shower stall only not a tub / shower .	1

In October of 2015 I purchased a top of the line Nissan Versa Note from Wesley Chapel NissanI brought it in for problems with the windshieldthis was not fixed properlyI brought it in a second time for the same issuestill not fixed properlythe third time the issue came up , the glass in the windshield came part out and all of the seal had pulled out infront of my and 2 passengers and myself this put our lives in dangerseeing that the problem could not be corrected properlyI had no option but , to trade out of that car this was really upsetting as I loved that carI was then sold a bottom of the line Altima because it was the cheapest they could get me intoI had to take on larger payments for longer time , not something I wanted to do but was really left with no choiceduring the sale of the 2017 Altima , I had a sales person named Jerry Bam Bam who did not communicate with me unless I went over his head though I emailed the general manager , he never respondedeven though I had been put through all of this due to negligent work on my windshield , the only compensation I was allowed was a Garmin navigator this was only because , the Versa had a navigator and the Altima did nothonestly , to get any help at all I had to go through Nissan of North America and file a complaintit took them stepping in to get free of these problemsno real compensation was ever really offered	0

This is another example of a piece of clothing that is made in a country where everyone is a size 0 . I contacted the vendor and they do not offer returns because it is too costly .

It impossible to get through when making a phone call .

Ridiculous ! I 'll never go back to your service Dept . I ca n't even get through to find out how much I have to pay or your receptionist does n't know what 's the latest time I can pick up my car and pay . Your service sucks !

I got this for a relative . I set it up and tested it and in the process became familiar with its capabilities .My relative was at home alone , fell and could not get up . It may sound trite and melodramatic , but if you 're the person who has fallen , if is frightening as it is to a relative many miles away .The first thing I checked about 5Star is which cellular network they use .I asked on their Facebook page and had an answer within two hours . Verizon . Had they used Sprint , I would have moved on .Sprint currently has the worst network of all the carriers and I 'm a 12 year customer of Sprint . Sprint is awful .I ordered the unit and tried it out . It works flawlessly . Follow the graphic instructions and you are up and running within a few minutes . The online registration is simple and gives you the opportunity to provide special instructions , such as the location of keys so emergency service responders do n't have to break down doors and such .5Star technical support which I called primarily to test it was readily available and well schooled , not only on the product , but network operation as well . 5Star customer support was quick to answer as well . Fortunately we have not had to use the 5Star in an emergency situation and I frankly hope that remains the case .The GPS is phenomenally accurate right down to the street address . I suspect they use nt only GPS but cell tower triangulation as well .5Star recommends that the battery be charged every night and I agree . You never want to have a dead battery on this kind of device .By the way , you can use this unit not only for summoning emergency help , but for less critical situations as well .Overall , I am please with unit and am very glad my relative has it . Makes me feel that he can summon help when he needs it , no matter where he is . Well worth the modest purchase price and monthly service fee .Jerry	1

This will be my thrid time using a Lou Fusz 2007 , 2015 for my husband , and now 2017I find their company to be honest , kind , and they do not rely on gimmicks or fast talk to sell . The woman I yalkes to on line was funny and easy going . When I got to the location I worked with Kris Portnoy to purchase my 2017 Kia Soul . He is kind , laidback , and easy to talk to . He answered my questions completely and gave me a fair price on the car and on my tradein . He did not pressure me or make me feel uncomfortable at anytime . He was able to get me in and out in less than 2 hours which is pretty awesome . I would highly recommend this company , the people , and its location to anyone .	1

I did n't realize it had bars on the back , probably designed to keep the phone off of surfaces to disperse heat .

I originally bought the Belkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiver . What a waste of money , the sound on that thing was tinny and just horrible .This unit is absolutely perfect . I have a Monster Cable iCarPlay Cassette Adapter with a Mini Jack connector that I used to plug into my Kindle or my Phone to play music in the car . The Silver Mini Adapter you see coming out of the Mpow unit is actually removable , so the Mini Jack can plug directly into the Mpow Unit . Additionally , the Micro USB adapter plugs into my Auto USB , charging the unit while it 's in use . Best of all , unlike some other units I 've seen advertised on Amazon , there 's ZERO interference if you 're charging while using the unit .04 / 29 / 2014 UpdateI attached my Asus TF101 to my passenger side visor to run Music and Videos Synced off Plex . I forgot that my phone was also connected via bluetooth , but I was pretty surprised when I was listening to some music and the music paused because a call was coming in on my Note 2 . I took the call which worked flawlessly with crystal clear sound and after the call was over , the music began to play again automatically . Nice !	1

i had an interesting experience in las vegas when i went to a rave theater . your system did n't have the correct name of the theater , so i spent 40 minutes trying to locate it . when we got there they told me that they do n't subscribe to fandango . what was really annoying was all the commercials we were forced to watch before seeing the movie . if theaters want to attract the baby boomers they better knock off the commercials ( i 'm not referring to previews . ) my husband and i will patronize theaters that are commercial free or we will wait for the movie on netflix .	0
I love this dealership ! ! ! They take such good car of their customers . You feel like you are part of their family . From Tim GM , to Thomas MGR , to Tony Finance , to our amazing sales guy Mohamad ! ! ! ! ! They listen to what you say , what you want , and then they find it for you . They are not pushy like most car dealerships . You are also in and out with a new car before you know it . Our paperwork was waiting for us when we got there ! I have purchased 6 cars from this dealership and I would n't go to ANY other dealership or any other Lexus ! My husband deals with all the dealerships on the peninsula and loves this place too ! That says a lot . If you need a new car you need to go to buy or lease a Lexus and more importantly you need to purchased it from Charles Barker in Newport News and go ask for Mohamad ! You wo n't be disappointed !	1

I tried to look on the Kensington website for info but there is no email so I guess I 'll have to call them to see if maybe they will exchange it . It was great the few times we were able to use it . My husband bought some cheap chinese knock off for his car for a few bucks and it works great . I also have a Motorola charger that works well but does n't have the juice to power an ipad . Maybe I just got a dud as I had another one of these and it lasted at least 6 months .	0
Thank God for my free sample of Advil Allergy Congestion Relief .It seems like there are so many different allergy products out on the market today . So how do you chose which will work for you ? I feel many times it is trial an error . I like looking for products that contain something different in their active ingredients .So when I saw one of the three active ingredients in Advil Allergy Congestion was 4 mg of Chlorpheniramine Maleate my interest was peaked . This ingredient is an antihistamine and when combined with 10 mg of Phenylephrine HCl a nasal decongestant you have a magical formula ! A magical formula that can reduce swelling due to nasal inflammation and relieve sneezing and runny nose messes . . .due to allergies .The third active ingredient will surprise you . . . .I am just kidding ! It is 200 mg of Ibuprofen . So your allergy headache will be gone in a jiffy .I love that fact that each does is 1 single pill . And the pill is nicely coated so you do nt ' have any after taste . Each dose only latest 4 hours , which can be good and bad , it depends on how you look at it and your needs . The box was clearly marked with information and instructions .I like the fact that Advil Allergy Congestion Relief does work for me . It does n't dry my mouth out and buts a stop to my sneezing totally .I received Advil Allergy Congestion Relief for free from Smiley360 .	1

As a caretaker , I needed some quality wipes to get the job done . The Tranguility brand seems to be the best product I have found so far , and especially for the price . It 's a good , strong product , with a nice moisturizing compound that does not irritate . It gets the job done , does n't break apart , and is the correct size for use on adult bodies .	1
Sub worthless . The clip and holster both conspire to tangle in clothing , resulting in numerous drops . Finally , since the geniuses put the clip on the face of the phone , the last time the clip flung the entire assembly to the floor , it smashed my screen , rendering my twomonth old Razr useless . I spent the remainder of my contract using a mothballed Droid 1 . That was a year and a half of misery . Thanks for nothing , which is what I should have bought instead .	0

Unwearable due to the huge , cardboardlike molded cups that pulled away from my body ! Just an illfitting disaster ! They are NOT supportive full coverage cups with side sling as the description states . The cups are ridiculously large and bulky , even for the size , which was 40DD .The racerback lace is so lightweight compared to the copiously thick cups that it immediately makes the band ride up , for further discomfort . Looks NOTHING like the photos ! !	0

Harvey caused quite a bit of destruction since I moved to the Houston area on Aug 12 . I needed a car just like thousands of others . After searching and talking to other dealerships who would n't work with me or would try to sell me something I was n't interested in , I met Jose Martell . Jose actually spoke to me like a human being . He listened to my needs and was able to answer my questions . If he was n't sure , he asked someone who did know . Everyone was able to make this experience one to remember . I know people in the business and have been around it long enough to know this is how you treat your customers . Thank you Jose Martell and crew !	1
I tried to schedule an appointment online to get my car serviced . Got a call 2 days later saying the date was n't available . We scheduled for a day the following week . The lady I spoken with was very kind , got my VIN to check if I had any recalls I had 2 so she asked if I could leave it overnight and stated they would get me a loaner . The appointment date arrived , but when I took thw vehicle in they had no record of my appointment . While they could fit me in for my service they could not get me a loaner and i did n't have the time to wait . So we had to reschedule for 2 days later . When I came back and dropped my car for that appointment it was 830 in the morning , I asked what time I could return to pick it up and was told 4 hours I was getting a 25k service , tires balance and rotated , and 2 recalls fixed . I called at 130 , got no answer so left a measage . Called again at 230 and was told it would be ready by the 5 pm more than 7 hours after I dropped it off . When I finally got to pick the car up , the service manager Brandon was there instead of the man I had seen earlier . He gave me the total an it wa 40 less that I had been told , which pleasantly surprised me . I mentioned it to hom and he stated , oh yea , i put a coupon on it . In my haste to get out I did n't look at the receipt until I got home that 's when I realized Brandon had lied and did not put a coupon on , his flat out did n't do my tire balance and rotation . He had the originally paperwork stating what my car was in for and instead of saying oh we made a mistake and kept your car nearly twice ad long as we promised and also did n't so half of what you asked he just lied . Now i have to find another day to spend without my car , in order to get this taken care of . You can believe it wo nt be going back to them .	0

Have been using an air cleaner or fans as a white noise generators for years , but decided I 'd like something more portable and with less blowing air , so purchased this unit . I was afraid it would n't be loud enough compared to the air cleaner , but this was clearly not the case . This small unit creates the perfect noise for masking outside sounds . It is plenty loud . . .in fact , I tuned it down a bit using the rotating top and collar . It masks conversation as well . Highly recommended .	1

My son has wide feet . These were recommended by the Stride Rite store after we had his feet fitted there . They do not carry New Balance but they do n't carry extra wide shoes either .

Given the price and performance of the LG Optimus L9 model LGP769 , I would have loved this phone , save for one simple problem . Its internal memory , otherwise known as ROM , is , as you know , only 4 GB . That would n't be so bad if you could offset that 4 GB with a 32 GB Sandisk card for about 32 extra , or less . However , what you do n't know , and ca n't know until / unless you actually have the phone in your hands and you actually log into your Google Play account to download an app , is that you , essentially , ca n't download any apps , because you have far less than 1 GB , depending on what apps come preloaded on your phone mine has only 600 MB of trulyfree available space . They operating system 34says34 you have 1 .8 GB of usable space , but , that comes preloaded with 600 MB of what turns out to be nonremoveable bload . Note this very clearly , that 600 MB of preloaded applications can NOT be deleted . It ca n't even be moved to the 32 GB microsd card . It 's there forever save a jailbreak , which is the only way to make this phone usable . Nobody will tell you this ahead of time , so , mark my words and see for yourself if you already own this phone . You can not move or delete the preloaded apps most of which are useless , and which are listed below . In a very short time , your remaining 600 MB of internal memory will be used up with apps , and , after that , you 're stuck . It 's a brick at that point . You ca n't download any new apps directly to the SD card , so , you 're stuck . In summary , all the specs of the phone are for naught if you ca n't put apps on it . So , it 's worthless . I 'm going to use mine as a test case for my first jailbreak , and , if I brick it by mistake , there is no real loss , it 's that worthless . The nonremovable apps that TMobile preloads on this phone are provided to me , by TMobile , and are as follows411 moreAlarm / clockAmazonApplication managerBackupBrowserCalculatorCalendarCaller TunesCamcorderCameraChromeCMASContactsDownloadsEmailFacebookFile managerFileShareGalleryGame BaseGamesGmailGoogleGoogle settingsGoogleLocalLookout SecurityMapsMemoMessagingMessengerMusicNavigationPhonePlay BooksPlay MagazinesPlay Movies TVPlay MusicPlay StorePolaris Office 4ScoutSettingsSetupSlacker RadioSmartphone Mobile HotspotSmartShareTMobile My AccountTMobile Name IDTMobile TVTalkTask ManagerVideosVisual VoicemailVoice RecorderVoice SearchWeatherYouTube	0

Really bad ethics . I mean they probably do n't know what ethics mean . I purchased a preowned car from them about 6 months ago . . At the time of purchase , the finance manage guaranteed a interest rate of 3 . 29 . Come to find out a few days ago that i m actually paying 4 . 29 . I understand its my mistake that it took me that long to figure it out . But i had full trust in them . I did n't know how heartless they can be at BMW of Fairfax . I called the finance department yesterday , and the explained my story . She kept comparing my rate to other customer rates . She could n't accept the fact that I 'm not those other customers . At the end , she went all out and said we have papers that YOU signed with this rate , so do what ever you want . A coworker was going to buy a car from them . Guess who 's not anymore ? Guess how many more family and friends will hear my story and wo n't go there anymore ?	0

coolness 4useability 0price 2 .5I love the idea of having my wallet and my phone in one place but the case really restrict the useability of the phone . If I only talk on the phone using my bluetooth , it will work great but for anything else . . . email , text , play games , watch movies , it is impossible to hold the phone properly with the case on .Yes , I could take the phone out of the case for those functions but then I would take my phone out of the case most of the time . I paid good money for my phone to just be a piece of eye candy , I want to play with it all the time .	0
dear paul yanover , on 12 12 12 , i called and canceled the gift card i ordered because the imax theatre would not take it for a birthday pesent to see the hobbit that i had purchased the gift card for . they told me that i would receive a call from the refund dept within a week . the employee was not only not helpful , but was very determined not to allow me a refund , but i persisted . it is now 1 7 13 and i have not yet received that call . and you still have my money and i do not . i felt that your website was misleading because when i went to your website i saw that the imax theatre in mesa was listed and thought that they would accept your fandango gift card because it stated online ticket sales not allowed . which to me indicated that you could go to the theatre and buy them instead . they do n't and i needed to get one that i could give to my grandson for his birthday on december 15th . i am hoping that as president . you can resolve this isue in a timely manner .	0
My husband is a gardener and has a sore foot which he refuses to have looked at . Due to his stubbornness about going to a doctor , I researched and found this . He loves it ! He said it hurt the first few times but now he uses it several times a day and he uses theTIGER BALM LINIMENT , 2 fl . oz Pack of 2with this . He rubs the liniment on his foot , then rubs his foot on the ball . I also will hold his foot on my lap sometimes and do the same . I 'd like to find this in an oblong shape to trace the whole bottom of foot like a tp tube shape .	1
Luxury Sales and ServiceJust a fantastic experience buying a car here . Never any pressure to buy now , but instead my sales guy Derek listened to what I wanted and led me to the choices he had . Always providing in depth information about the car and the features . I let him know I was still a month away from buying and it was no problem at all . He would drop me an email checking in to see if I needed anything . When it was finally time to buy , it took us about 15 minutes to make the deal . The follow up has been great . I dropped in a few times just to ask questions and have some of the features explained to me . Never any problem , they were happy to help . Which if you 've looking at a late model car is a big deal with the touch screens and all the options , its a complex machine on the inside anymore .	1

i have to say . . . i thought fandango was great when i used it a few times to buy tickets ahead of time for my girlfriends and i when we were starting our ladies ' nights with a movie . i decided to buy several gift cards for family and friends . i checked the fandango site to make sure theaters local to those people were places that sold tickets online . turned out , not one of the three gift cards got used because the theaters i thought would accept them would n't take them or when they got online , the site froze up and would n't function for them with the gift card . i did n't believe my sisters . . . thought they were just technologically challenged . . . but the cards in fact , did not work . . . they did n't tell me this of course for several months and i felt it was too late to do anything about it . but it was very disappointing to have spent 100 or more , i do n't remember , on gift cards that did n't work .

Unbelievable rude ! We were approached by Consuelo who asked us if we were interested in the car . We were and wanted a test drive . We 've been looking for a month to replace one of our existing cars but this was only our second dealer of the day . She asked if we were willing to buy today , BEFORE we 'd even seen the inside of the car or driven it ! ! Really ? ! Since we said no , they apparently did n't have time for our questions . We were asked to come back another day . Nope ! Never going there again .	0

Just purchase a NEW 2017 GX . I 've owned Acura my whole life and decided to give Lexus a try . Within 24 hours of taking the new car home a strange popping sound came from the front right tire . Fast forward , there was a piece up in the wheel well that was cracked , said it was a factory defect . Fast forward another week there is ANOTHER problem with the gas tank making this horrible siren sound when removing the gas cap . So loud that people stare at me when I 'm at the gas station . I 've tried to speak with the salesman , i 've contacted the manager and NOTHING has been done other than just passing me off from person to person . Clearly I was sold a defective car and just want one that actually works . Absolutely unprofessional and extremely disappointing experience . A brand new car should never have this many problems in less than a two week timeframe .	0
Anything that is gluten free deserves a star . So it got one . Other than that it did n't work out . It was sort of like toosweet cardboard . Gritty cardboard .Think thin ? Really ? For weight control I keep the fat content of my diet as low as possible . My body is good enough at making fat without giving it excess . And this regimen does work for me . So this snack bar is off limits . I am not impressed with the other ingredients either .It is important to me to be able to keep emergency food in my vehicle but this melted into a mess plus crumblies flew all over the place it managed to be both of those things . You 'd think they were mutually exclusive but apparently not .	0
i am very frustrated by fandango and your gift cards . one of my students gave me a card over a year ago . i found it this week and attempted to use it . unfortunately it had not been activiated according to your website . so now i am supposed to go back to this family and tell them that it needs to be activated and find out where they bought it . what happens if they do nt ' have a receipt and the store refuses ? will i put them in an awkward position of feeling bad about my gift ? ? ? i do n't want my students to feel bad ! why is n't there a better system to prevent this from happening ? i certainly do n't want them to spend another 25 . 00 !	0
I had very high hopes for this case based on the reviews and on my fatherinlaw 's 5C case . I thought it would fit tighter . The inside soft shell is VERY loose and flimsy , which makes the outer hard shell difficult to get on properly . Once the outer shell is on , the soft part bulges slightly . I really am SO disappointed . It 's such a good brand and they really need to make it fit tighter .Edited to add The outer part broke when trying to take it off . ! This thing is a piece of junk . Do not buy it ! !	0

website is fine . my concern was with the paperless ticketing i tried to use the other day . i had my fandango tickets on my phone , but the ticket taker could n't get the scanning gun to read it , so i had to go back down and wait on the line so they could print a ticket that i could take back upstairs to the ticket taker ! ! seems like an extra waste of time , not to mention my fee for the benefit of not having to wait on line ! ! !	0

Worst BMW dealer I have encountered in 4 states 8 BMW purchases After being a longtime BMW fan 8 time owner in Florida , NY , CT , and NJ , I purchased the flagship i8 model from Paul Miller BMW . This dealership showed no interest in me as a customer . After 4 months , I am still trying to get the title of a vehicle I paid cash for . The BMW brand is getting severely damaged by this dealer and it is hard to be a fan of a product when dealing with a dealership like Paul Miller BMW	0

We thought that this place was great when we bought our car , but then came the problems . Like normal when buying a vehicle , we got a temp tag which gives u a month to get registered / plates . Unfortunately , we did n't get close to that . After about a week we were told that there was a problem with the 1st banknot our fault so they had to use a different one . It took so long for them to get everything straight for us to actually get the paperwork we needed to get the vehicle registered that we now only had a few days until our temps ran out . We r both busy people we did n't think it was fair that we only had a few days to get it registered now . There 's a reason they give u a months worth of temp . So considering everything that none of this was our fault , we felt like it would only be fair for them to give us another temp so that we would have at least another week . But the manager refused to do anything at all about it even though none of this was our fault . We will not be getting another vehicle here or referring anybody .	0

Bait and Switch TacticsSaw an for sale ad on Craigslist for 2002 Buick Century Custom 1797 . Called the phone number listed and set up an appointment for an inspection / test drive . When I got to the appointment , the staff could n't locate the car , they spent 45 minutes searching . While waiting , they asked if I would like to see another car . Talked to assistant sales manager , he said that car had safety issues and was unavailable . Phoned dealership to talk to sales manager . He said that he would look into the issue . Never heard back from him . Called next day and talked to another sales manager . He said the car was taken off lot by an auction house and was now unavailable . Craigslist and the dealers web site still list the vehicle as available . Another weird thing was that the CarFax lists that the dealership has owned the car for 5 months and that it had a recent service 13 days ago .	0

2ND update / review . The case started to fall apart . The flapswhere u have the volume the bottom where u charge it Where u can plug in earphone all fell apart . When I spoke with the company they could n't replace it said they didNot have any more . So I had to spend money again purchase from another company . Also the holster broke ! ! I 'd personally go for another company .I had an iPhone 4 for almost 2 yrs yes it has dropped before , but never broke . . . . . Until . . . . . So I was very reluctant to get an otter box b / c I had one when I 1rst bought my phone . . . . But as much of a protector it was , the pic I took stunk ! ! ! I read the reviews read that the defender case made the camera hole larger so it 's better . Well being 1 / 2 the price . . . . the good reviews , I thought I 'd try it . The only negative thing I d say is the rubber that 's around the case itself . . . I have n't had it very long my rubber has a small rip in it . I am going to contact the seller see if I can get the rubber replaced . I 've dropped my phone several times not even a scratch . In the stores this case is over 50 . . . . 1 / 2 the price here . . . . I LOVE the pink ! ! ! ! ! Even the holder is better then my old one . Easier to put in out of the holder . Yes it gets dusty , so once a week I take it all off wash the plastic covering that protects the glass so the dust is easily removed .	0
Got this case and everyone loved looking at the design of the iPhone 5s back . People always ask where I get this case and love looking at it . I dropped my phone a few times and the AirCushioning really helps out .	1

Bernie explained what was done , and also answered some questions that I had .	1
This place is a scam . They sell lemons to public without revealing everything about the vehicle . We bought a 2008 preowned 7 series from this dealership . It was nothing but problems with this car from day 1 . It kept asking to add oil to it . We knew that there must be some type of an oil leak . They kept telling us that it 's because of the driving my husband does . I have never heard of such an excuse from any dealer for any car . The reason that it kept asking to add oil was because of the leak that they deliberately kept quiet about until last week . Finally , they tell us about the leak and of course we had to pay to fix it . They replaced 4 tires for us and charged us arm and a leg last year . Now they are telling us the tires are worn out and need to be replaced . This does n't end here . 3 days ago , it showed a light for some transmission issues , which they never revealed to us a week ago . Now the whole transmission needs to be replaced costing us 8800 or so . This place is not untrustworthy and their customer service is despicable . They sold us a lemon and made thousands of dollars thereafter in fixing numerous problems with the car . They wo n't even print out everything we have fixed in the car with them saying it 's too much work to do so . We are filing a complaint with the attorney general 's office . Let them deal with this awful dealership . Stay away from them .	0

i only join fandango so i could tell you how i feel ripped off by this service i bought tickets thru this site so we would not have to stand in line , just go to the box insert my credit card and get tickets . what a joke , the dang box does not work . has not for quit a while , they keep saying they are going to move it inside and hook it up again is what we were told after standing in the afternoon heat for over 20 minutes to get our ticket . at the very least you should return the 3 . oo service fee since you box does not work . oh yea , do n't ask for the confirmation because the ticket teller kept the print out after several words as to how i was not going to pay for the tickets again . ripped off by this joke of a service	0

Being someone who is credit challenged I went to Fuccillo Kia because I ve heard such great things about them helping people rebuild credit . They did nt even submit my application for financing before an employee I 'm assuming a manager come over and said I can already look you in the eye and tell you the answer is no . I had money to put down , I was extremely flexible on the car , and I was willing to accept a high rate but everyone 's mind was made up before my application was even submitted . On a different note , the employee who helped me Luis was a very pleasant fellow .	0
If by XL , you mean a child 's size XL , well then these are spot on . The fact I normally wear an XL shirt , I bought a few of these Fruit Of The Loom shirts , and they fit horribly .

Customer service not up to par . BMW of Mountain View is always busy . Yes , there 's a lot of folks with money in the area now and they are all buying BMWs . Good thing for the dealership which seems swamped with customers . Bad for customer service however . I recently scheduled a service for our 5 series sedan there . Upon scheduling , they did mention transportation after dropping off for service . They had provided a loaner car in the past and I assumed they would provide one for this appointment as well . Definitely my fault , but it would be nice if they had reminded me to request one . On the day of I called for transportation and was told no more loaners were available . However , they did offer a shuttle service . I asked the lady at the shuttle desk how long the wait would be , since I had a meeting scheduled after the service drop off . She told me that there were 4 drivers and that I would not have to wait at all . Feeling confident after that call , I thought I could rely on the shuttle . When I dropped off my car , the wait ended up being 30 minutes . There was a sign saying it could take up to 30 minutes something mentioned over the phone . After 30 minutes was up I could n't wait any longer and had to take an Uber back instead . I asked the service representative , Daniel , to see if I could be reimbursed for the Uber ride . He said that I would be . However , despite leaving messages and texts for Daniel the past few days , my request for reimbursement is being soundly ignored . I can eat the 20 but it 's absurd that a company can sell a 60k car and then avoid returning your phone call for 20 . If you 're looking for a BMW , I 'd look elsewhere .	0

Life changing experience !	1
1 / 6 / 2013 UpdateDowngrading this phone to one star . When I picked up a fully charged phone the light turned green and immediately checked the battery power , it was only showing 97 instead of 100 power ! WTH ! The battery drains very quickly with this phone . I constantly have to check the phone and turn things off . In addition , when I am done talking on the phone , the screen goes blank ! I have to hit the power button in order to turn things on so I can hang up the call . Moreover , if I want to check my voicemail , I need to get outside of the phone menu and use a voicemail button . The unlimited 3 G speed is such a joke . In some areas , I was getting 0 .01 MB upload speed ! Forget about watching YouTube and VEVO with this phone . Besides that , I frequently push the camera button by accident . As a matter of fact , I once pushed the camera button accidentally while I was using the Google Navigation App not very good in my car . When the camera was capturing the outside world on the screen , I thought Google had incorporated Street View in its Navigation app ! I will be cancelling my 35 / month service with VM and I will be using this phone strictly as a backup portable MP3 and Google Play device WiFi . The 35 unlimited Data / Text message plan is only great if you have a 4 G phone and when you are in a 4 G coverage area .Based on my personal testing during the past five days covering San Francisco to Lake Tahoe , ATT 's LTE offers the fastest speed for upload and download . It is faster than Verizon . However , Verizon 's system seems to have less drop calls in certain areas using iPhone 5 's . If VM drops the purchase price of a 4 G phone to less than 50 , I will do a report on my findings on VM 's 4 G speed and coverage .xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI have so many cell phones but I did n't own an Android phone . When I saw the ad last weekend , I bought this phone at Radio Shack for only 49 .99 on sale . After playing with this phone for three hours , there are so great things about this phone but there are also some terrible things with this phone .1 . Great ringtones ! I love them ! 2 . I love the live background .3 . It has builtin WiFi .4 . It handles 32 GB SD card with ease .5 . Its UI is awful . iOS is far more superior .6 . Its camera is garbage grade .7 . Its music player Google Play is very good . Currently , Google allows you to upload 20 , 000 songs in the cloud for free . Furthermore , it downloaded album cover for most of the albums .8 . The OS would freeze for no reason .9 . Battery life is only OK .10 . It is bulky .11 . It is also heavy .12 . It does not have a front facing camera .13 . The back cover for the battery feels fragile .14 . The OS can be customized .15 . The speaker is fairly loud .16 . I like the long pull out keyboard .17 . Call sound quality is average .Overall , it is the cheapest Android phone I have found so far . It is definitely a good buy if saving money is the number one priority . As far as the UI for a smart phone is concerned , look elsewhere .	0

I bought this because I 've always trusted Arm Hammer use a lot of their other products and when it said 34Natural34 and 34does not contain aluminum34 etc . , I figured it would be great . Unfortunately , it contains triclosan , which ditches the 34natural34 label . The 34natural34 scent is actually the fake pine scent used every Christmas in a multitude of items and it 's so heavy , it smells like someone spilled a container of Lysol on you .Sad , because they 're a good company . I hope they read their reviews .	0

Spent 25 dollars for this reusable bed pad . After the first washing , it started to fray around the edges . Contacted BHmedwear to find out if they would honor a replacement . They said that they would replace the unit if I returned the frayed item to them . Took the return to UPS and paid 10 to ship it to BHmedwear . Suddenly , the expensive 25 pad is costing me a more expensive 35 . Hopefully , the replacement pad will not fray .Again , learned a valuable lesson . Do not buy from any third party suppliers on Amazon . If Amazon does n't supply it , DON'T BUY IT . Amazon should insist that their suppliers offer prepaid return shipments .	0

I 've been using POLAR heart rate monitors since the late 1980s . This experience is different than the regular heart rate monitor / watch / download to PC standard . I have this paired with the H7 sensor .This tracker has FEWER Functions than a regular polar heart rate monitor . If you really want to geek out , check out some of the watches and the modes available on them the H7 sensor works on many watches , as well as the loop . For that reason , I was skeptical but I love gadgets . In fact , I bought this not at amazon , but at REI because it would be easier to return there as I assumed I would after the 34novelty34 of a new gadget wore off .But I 'm not returning it . If I want some really good heart rate info , I 'll just use one of my monitorswatches . But for day to day , lazy just do it , this is good enough . VERY basic as far as heart rate monitors go .I have a fitbit one , which is a fun thing I throw in my pocket to count steps . I still use it to monitor sleep , because the LOOP does not monitor sleep . The fitibit is also more discreet I can wear it when this black band would be awkward .However , I find that the black wristband is n't as unsightly as I thought it would be . It is sleek looking , plain , and really not conspicuous at all . At first , I cut the band only slightly . Wearing it as a 34bangle34 is annoying and does n't work . Once I cut it to truly an appropriate size , it was great . Is great . I wear it all the time , 24 / 7 , and do n't even notice it .I use it for P90X , now P90X3 , and to count my steps for fun . When working out on P90X3 , I just tap a spot on my band and the HR quickly displays . I quickly sync to the laptop cable required , and it is fun to see the graphics of when I worked out hard and when I did n't , and how fast my HR recovers . Easy sync . The charge lasts a very long time , and does n't need a PC to charge you can charge via USB / wall like you would an iPhone .Also , polar customer service is great . On the H7 sensor , I accidentally pulled off one of the snaps , rendering the sensor useless . I contacted polar , and they immediately sent me a replacement , no charge , no need to return , 100 my satisfaction . Awesome .On days in which I am out of town or unable to do P90X , tracking the activity is oddly a good feature . I 'm not sure how exact it is , but . . . the point is , if I 've spent too much time in a coffee shop and not enough 34active , 34 the wristband is a good , hard to ignore metric . It gives me a kick to meet my 34activity level34 even if I 'm out of town .I like this because it is 100 waterproof , I can wear it 100 of the time , and when I ca n't formal function , need that tennis bracelet on that lean arm instead of this band , I can wear the fitbit just to keep me honest .I love gadgets , and this one works .	1

I bought 2 cars from KIA LITHIA 2 YEARS AGO in September 2015 and recently bought another car in April 2017 and had a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE with them , you be the judge . Here 's what happened . . . On April 21 , 2017 I paid in full 6 , 000 for a used 2008 Chevy Equinox and it is now May 2 , 2017 and I still have not received my car nor keys to my car NOTHING ! I have reached out to the representative who sold the car to me his name is Richard SueSue and we corresponded via email about getting one issue fixed before I pick up my car . In the emails we talk about the fact that the car does not lock or unlock and it is a safety issue . He says his GM agreed to get it fixed and I have it in writing for the contract I signed to buy the car which states on the WE OWE statement that they will fix the car and make sure it locks and unlock electronically . I mean , I have it in writing on the paperwork at my house there s no getting around this . Here how bad this situation has gotten . . . I have email correspondence that Richard SueSue told me on 4 different occasions that my car was taken to the shop and would be ready and it is still not ready 2 weeks later after he told me in an email it will only take 2 days to be fixed . In fact , when I emailed him to see about getting my car back he has not reached out since . At this point it considered fraud . He told me that they can not sell a car to a consumer if the doors do not lock unlock because it is a safety issue and they would have to sell it to the auction but if they can get it fixed I can buy it . So , I bought the car on his word that he would fix it . Thankfully , I made sure I got it in writing and will take them to court to get my money back but ladies and gentleman . Please do yourself a favor and do not buy a car from LITHIA KIA of ANCHORAGE . Unless you want to go to court to get your money back . UNBELIEVABLE what people will and how they will treat you for a couple of dollars . LASTLY the managers SUCK ! GM down are a bunch of money hungry people who do n't care about you or the service only your money . I 'm just telling like it is . .	0
Some quick thoughts on this model specifically Removes smaller hairs than earlier models , so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back The massagers on the epilation head really do help You can use it dry or completelywet , but not damp e .g . , right after the shower wo n't work You ca n't use it while plugged in that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower ! but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge , you 'll have to toss the unit I wish it included a trimming head , for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack they have to be 1 cm or shorter before this will really pull them out The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed The wipes really do help . You 'll use one and think it did n't help that much , then try the other leg without one at all , and realize it WAS helping more than you realized I used them the first time I epilated , but have n't bothered subsequently . Update after a year or two of using this item , the cap pops off while you 're using it , which is seriously annoying . But I love it apart from that .And some thoughts on epilation in general This seems obvious , but I have to say it it only hurts when a hair is being removed . This means that the first time you epilate , it 's very uncomfortable . But since only a small percentage of the hair later grows back , the subsequent touchups really are n't bad at all , especially on your legs . Underarms are less comfortable , and bikini area even less so . The first time you epilate , your legs will be unbelievably smooth . But hair grows back at different rates , so after a month or so of epilating maybe one time each week , you 'll have tiny hairs here and there , that are starting to grow back , but are still too small to get . It 's less of an issue with this epilator than others , and the hairs are n't really visible . So if you think someone 's going to be touching your legs , then shave D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so . Then if you do n't bother doing anything for a month or so , you 'll have a few stray hairs here and there , but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month or even a week . . . or even 3 days . Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past . You do have to use a loofah or some other type of exfoliation on your legs occasionally to prevent ingrown hairs just little bumps on your legsmine do n't turn red . But if you wax , or if you age you 'll have to do that anyway And how could I forget the 1 reason to epilate no more underarm bumps . You know , the ones that you ALWAYS have , despite a million products on the market that say they 'll banish them but do n't ? Sometimes when you epilate , your skin will be red for 3090 seconds afterward , but then it fades . So NO MORE BUMPS . That alone is reason enough to own an epilator , IMO	1
I bought the black leggings with pleather insets . For the price , I was n't expecting very good quality to begin with , but when I saw the material , it was laughable how poor the quality was . Let 's try a simile if the quality of regular 4 leggings from Forever 21 was like paper , the quality of these leggings was like offbrand tissue paper . I immediately returned them ! The elastic waistband is also super dorky . I bought another brand of very similar look LOCOMO and the quality was just as poor ! Thank goodness for free returns via Prime !	0
If you screw the end on too tight , it turns up to the highest setting and stays there . If you have the end on too loose , it goes to the high setting .

A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc . as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners . Stevia is made from herb in South America . Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said . It 's quite a bit sweeter than sugar , so you need less of it as a replacement .I like this brand and put two packets in one cup iced coffee every morning with 1 1 / 2 cup almond milk , 1 / 2 cup lowfat milk and 1 T cocoait tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 150 calories as the stevia is caloriefree ! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great , refreshing treat for the day .This is a way to have sweet taste without sugar .	1

As for myself , this is the third week and with hope of being regular it has n't made a bit of difference . I am going to continue the product with hope it will kick in . If it works I will write a review . Keeping my fingers crossed .	0

love this theatre . however , no matter how hard you try , their are people who still just have to check their cell and text an answer while the movie is on . it is extremely disturbing and i can not believe people feel that important that they ca n't let 2 3 hours of their life be phone text free just to enjoy the movie they and we all paid to see without the glare of their cell phones . i have no idea how to resolve this terribly disturbing issue .	0
They fit perfectly but I knew my size from my old pair of Birkenstock Arizona sandals . I wear them often , even dress them up ! They are my favorite pair of shoes . They last forever .	1
I ordered a medium . I fit in all medium shirts I buy . This comes from Asia , so maybe it is because they are smaller people over there . This is a baby 's side medium .	0
hello my name is ricardo ramirez and i 'm from pembroke pines florida . a few weeks ago i purchased 2 tickets through fandango for the premiere of the movie despicable me 2 ( july 3rd ) and when i went to obtain my ticket the worker at the movie theater ( cinemark paradise 24 in davie ) she told me that there were some problems with fandango with the tickets and that the purchase was not completed . she also said that fandango would refund my money . it 's almost been 3 weeks and i still have n't received my money back . again my name is ricardo ramirez from pembroke pines florida and you can contact me at 786 712 7055 or at my email ricardoaramirez96 hotmail . com . thank you .	0
And I have used a few . This one comes with an awesome felt case , and a micro usb charging cable . The cable is also a 34flat34 cable and will not tangle . I have fully charged and discharged this a few times now and have been able to Fill my note 2 fully twice and then some ! I also get comments on how nice it looks . For the price , there is nothing better then this .	1
This product works great . I had an itching on the soal of my foot . Went to the doctor and he said it was athlets foot . I tried all kinds of foot fungus products on it and the itching would not go away . I applied some ResQ cream on it for about a week and the itching stopped . I feel better now . I bet it would be good for poison ivy or bug bites too . They give you a big tube not a small amount like those other products .	1

I was on the fence about these for 9 months and finally caved . So happy ! There are 5 different sized snaps 2 of each in each pack , so 10 in all . They all look the same but there really are 5 different sizes in each pack so do n't get frustrated , I PROMISE they will more than likely fit MOST onesies / bodysuits you have . I think those that were dissatisfied did n't try all the snaps they even work on the plastic snaps . So far , the only ones I have that they do n't fit are Ed Hardy . ALL the other onesies / bodysuits I own , they fit . They fit Disney , Rocawear , Apple bottoms , Dereon , Baby phat , Blac label , DG Dollar general , Sesame street , Dwell studio , Janie jack , LL bean , Old navy , Carters , Gerber , Calvin klein , Beverly Hills Polo club , Ralph Lauren , Faded glory , Garanimals , Nike , Circo , Small wonders . . .the list goes on ! My daughter is 10 months thanks to these , can still fit 36 month bodysuits / onesies , and even some of her 03 month sizes ! Plus I wash her clothes in Woolite dark , so her clothes still look new and I get a big bang for my buck ! ! The only small downside is that some of her onesies are too small without them and too big with them . . .go figure	1
I 've owned 4 different pairs of the Mary Jane style Keen shoes . Every shoe has failed elastic where the buckle attaches and when this happens while you are walking you suddenly lurch forward right out of the shoe . No way will it stay on . Happens less than a year after purchase cost 20 to fix in a cobbler shop . I 've emailed Keen several times . They deny it 's a problem but there is another negative review posted on REIs website with photos describing the same problem . I recommend that you carry duct tape if you buy these shoes !	0
I give this item one star , but it is worth zero stars . I work with plastics and items in this condition should not be for sale at any price . The fit was barely OK with some looseness on the top . The cutouts , on the left side of the phone , were quite a bit off . The on / off switch was partially covered by the case as was one of the volume buttons . On the back side , there was a little hole with exessive plastic flash around it . This location could have been the gate , where plastic comes in to the mold tooling forming this case . Just this type of defect would normally sent a product to the scrap bin .The product came directly from Hong Kong in about 6 weeks . Yes , it was a bargain , at 20 times less expensive than same item sold at Best Buy , but it is not even worth its very low price .	0
This battery pack does take a couple hours to charge itself , but once it 's charged up , I 'm amazed how many other devices it can charge . It juiced up my three ipods and two phones on a single Anker charge . Fantastic for overseas flights or long trips .Recommend the accompanying charger to help the Anker charge up as quickly as possibleI purchased one as a gift for my father and his experience remains equally fantastic .	1
For me , the many claims of weight loss and more energy and appetite suppression are false .

I came in today to get my tire changed . After an hr went by I was informed that my rim was slightly dented and that 's what caused the pimple in my tire so I 'd need a new rim too . I told the service lady I was not able to replace the rim today for 233 and I would get it from my father for cheaper another day to go ahead and put the new tire on . An hr later she says I 'm ready to go they put the car in my truck . I waited 2 hrs for them to put a tire in my truck . When I spoke to a manager about this he seemed unbothered by it , all he could offer me was an I 'm sorry . This is not the first problem I 've had with this dealership , but it will be the last .	0

I bought these for my husband and he loves them . In fact , ten minutes after he opened them on Christmas morning , we got on Amazon and bought two more pair in other colors !

These shoes cost about 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the 2 to waterproof them .

I bought this splint to support my thumb for my de quervain 's tenosynovitis I was trying to selftreat without going to the doctor and I bought this splint from the local pharmacy . I have two issues with this splint first the design , then its usefulness .This is a velcro splint with two metal stabilizing bars that are removable so you can wash the splint . One bar goes under the thumb and the other over the thumb . The metal bars are bendable so you can conform them to the shape of your hand the problem is that they are too bendable . You have to readjust them every time you put the splint on . Also , if you are trying to move your hand to do something like vacuum or sign something at those credit card signature pads at the grocery store , you will bend the metal bar and have to bend it back to put your wrist back into a neutral position . After about a month and a half , the bar that went over the top of the thumb actually broke in half . That wound up being a good thing since I found out that the split is more comfortable without that top bar . The top bar goes right over the tendon sheath that is inflamed with De Quervain 's tenosynovitis causing more irritation . It did help somewhat with my discomfort once the top bar broke , but it did not offer good enough support , so I still had quite a bit of pain . In another two months , the bottom bar broke .Since I was still trying to selftreat my De Quervain 's tenosynovitis and there were no other better braces in any local pharmacies , I bought another one . I immediately took out the top bar and put it in my old splint in the bottom bar slot so I would have two splints . After breaking one of those bars I finally went to the doctor who gave me two splints that actually work for De Quervain 's tenosynovitis and are a lot sturdierOTC Lightweight Breathable Wrist / Thumb Splint , Right , MediumandModabber Thumb Orthosis Size Standard Wrist Cir . 5 91 / 2 Thumb Orthosis Model 55987902	0

i would say that a more clear message to customers that not every theatre listed on fandango 's website accepts fandango gift cards would be nice . my husband and i took a recent date night to the monaco in huntsville , al with one of your gift cards . we raced there living close to 30 miles away as our schedules just did n't allow for us to go together any earlier and barely enough time to make it there . but we were so excited to go out alone with no children ) to the nicest theatre in our area thinking that because it was listed on fandango 's website that the card would be accepted . finally got there and could hardly get a parking space uuuugh ( then , we make it to the ticket counter discuss seating and try to pay with our card only to find out they do n't accept them there . we were so disappointed and just chose instead of paying cash to not see a movie that evening at all . gave the card to a younger couple as a late christmas gift for their own date night .	0
the last 2 times i ' ve tried to purchase tickets from fandango website i ' ve had problems that caused me to have ot go to my movie theater instead . i will choose the time of the movie and the number of tickets and when i click continue i get sent back to the page with a message that says please select the number of tickets then sometimes i get a message saying that my session has timed out due to inactivity even when i still have more than 5 minutes left on the clock . i have repeatedly tried to go back and i keep getting one of these two messages . this has caused me to not want to even try to use this website again . it 's supposed to be convenient and keep us from having to go all the way up to the theater instead it causes more problems and frustrations .	0

I called up 650PM today , Friday June 23 , 2017 and Michelle the phone operator transferred me to a female Sales Rep who did n't even know biz terminologies so I requested that I be transferred to the Financing Department but the phone kept on a Loop . I dunno if the receptionist purposely rounded my call coz the voicemail says press the pound key if i like to leave a message or press Zero for the Operator but I never got to get connected again . I think since they knew my caller ID then they purposely misrerouted me , to a never ending transfer . I 've always thought that a BMW dealer is way much better than an independent NoNamer dealer . This dealer 's Sales Financing dept is WORST and NOT even promising . How can they even sell if they 're denying a caller ? GRR	0

This scarf is made of the poorest quality ever ! ! I would rate it a zero star if I could . The material is very thin , nearly transparent .

I bought this to replace an older model of Waterpik Water Flosser . The older model 's tubing kept splitting because it had become brittle .This new models pump is not as strong as the old model . I bought this new model in 2012 and am writing this review in 2014 .Within six months the model started choking . The pump worked but no water coming out or weak . I called Waterpik and complained . They hymned and hawed and claimed that it was build up because of water quality . I told them this is not true . I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the country . It comes from a granite lined reservoir in the mountains and the city water has to add so that it does n't eat at the pipes . On top of that my older Waterpik never had a problem over the years I have had it . They sent a new head tube unit this did not work .I cleaned it with running vinegar through . Sometimes this worked sometimes not . I found just filling the reservoir with water and putting the handle in the sink and letting it drip out sometimes solved the problem . Eventually the unit stopped working all together no matter what I did . I will contact Waterpik again . I do n't expect anything because I am probably beyond their warranty period .I found a repair handle tube on Amazon ASINB000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle . and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems . You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle . My review title on the repair kit is Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different installThis new Waterpik they are using a different pump that is supposedly quieter . Relatively it is but both it and the old pump are loud . You ca n't pump water quietly . But who cares the pump is a little quieter if it breaks down and does n't work . If you have an old water pick fix it !	0

My experience was a little different than most because I bought my 2017 Kia Sedona from South Florida from a auto trader ad . My wife called and was Blessed to get Marco Neal as my car sales person . Marco was exceptional , very patient , kind and responsive . From the first call to the time we had the van delivered to my home in Ft Lauderderdale . It was a positive experience from Marco , Jeff Hacker his boss , to Jennifer the title agent . Maybe I should say it was a WOW experience . Not what I expected from a Auto Dealer .

Vendor Medical Supply Store shipped this rollator to me . I ordered Winnie Lite Supreme 3 Wheel Aluminum Model 10218 . What I received was a different model 10289 substituted without my permission . The Winnie Lite is 12 lbs . The one I got is 16 .5 lbs . Winnie Lite 's slightly smaller wheels and the brake design and brake warranty are superior in my opinion . I called the manufacturer , Drive Mechanical , and was advised they discontinued the Winnie Lite although still shown on Drive Medical website . Amazon lists the other rollator 10289 as a separate item with fewer review stars than the Winnie Lite . Amazon should no longer list the discontinued Winnie Lite . While the new model might work for some , it does not work for me . I am especially frustrated at the switch to the different rollator without disclosing that up front to consumers . Now I must wait for snail mail return label from the vendor . All round an unpleasant experience .	0

I want to compliment Mr . James Saunders and Mr . Roberto Sanchez for their extraordinarily exceptional customer service that was given to me . I had a few issues with my 2012 BMW 328i . Mr . Saunders was very knowledgeable about my car and extended warranty coverage . My passenger restraint malfunction light was on and my service light was on as well . My car 's auto / start / stop function was shutting off my radio whenever the car would stop which is not supposed to happen . Mr . Saunders informed me that my car was covered for oil changes , and that there was a separate battery for the auto / start / stop function . The separate battery was n't covered but Mr . Saunders made sure that I did n't have to pay for the extra expense . He also made sure that my car was washed a second time because it had rained earlier that day . Finally , he was very caring and made me feel like a VIP customer . For Mr . Sanchez , I have encountered him on several occasions to my visits to the repair center and he always greets me with a warm smile . I think that he 's the intake specialist not sure of his exact title . He really went out of his way to get my car to me after it was washed . While I was sitting waiting for my car to pull up , the driveway was blocked . So he pulled all the way around the repair center and backed up into the stall nearest me so I would n't have to walk to my car . That was such a nice gesture and I really appreciated it . I just want to say thanks for the excellent customer service .	1

You can see this in the products picture .I recently dropped my phone on the street and guess which part of my phone was scratched ? You guessed it , the part that was left exposed by the geniuses at elago .If you buy this case , you 'll need to do something to protect this exposed corner .Cheers !	0

I ordered 2 of the twin pack 90 in one bottle , 30 in the other It was cheaper than buying the bottle with 240 go figure . Maybe this is why it was cheaper the bottle with 30 only had 28 caps I 've only opened one bottle so far . I wrote to Carlsons a week ago and they have n't even sent an automated thanks for contacting us , we 'll get back to you reply .I do n't like being ripped off , especially for a relatively expensive supplement like this . And I definitely do n't appreciate the manufacturer ignoring my questions . I know , this is n't about the quality of the product per se , but I think it 's relevant to others who might be considering purchasing from Carlson 's . As for me , it 's back to Nordic Naturals . I wo n't deal with a company that cheats its customers . By the way , yes , I 'm willing to consider it was a mistake , but their not replying to me is no mistake . They 've lost my business .	0
I had run my dishwasher and forgot to rinse a dish I had used with pesto and some other herbs and spices and needless to say my glasses were pretty spotty and a lot of residue was left over . I ran the dishes again with my regular pods and they still were grainy and baked with residue even though I did not use the dry cycle . So I tried the Finish Quantum with Lemon Sparkle pods and I was really surprised . My glasses and crystal came out flawless , my dishes were sparkling and my dishwasher was super clean . I still did not use the dry cycle . I have used Finish pods in the past but switched to a different brand but I am switching back with the Lemon Sparkle . Not only did it clean my dishes and dishwasher but also everything smelled fresh and clean . The pods come with some powder , a red power ball and a yellow liquid which I would say is the Lemon Sparkle in a triangular shape . I have a round detergent dispenser and the pod fit is just fine . They were packaged well in a plastic container inside a cardboard box . I can not wait to run the dishwasher again .	1
Not a great experience at all we were pressured into purchasing a car we were not 100 sure we wanted and it was not the style or color we wanted either and we were also left with money owed after we were told everything was covered however , by the time we received the bill we were told there is nothing they can do about it and we were stuck paying a large bill to Nissan . . . . Also , after less than a year we are already experiencing issues with the car and it has been a complete hassle trying to get in contact with anyone at Nissan to get it fixed under warranty or even just to get someone on the phone . I would not recommend using this company the customer service is not great and the quality of the cars are not great .	0

Not liking the reviews I am reading now . . .wish I had looked before I bought . Just kinda wondering when I will see these ? I ordered them almost 2 weeks ago and still not here . I ordered 3 more items from Amazon THIS WEEK and all came in 34 days with standard shipping . Hope these actually show up sometime soon and work properly . Will post a follow up review on that after I try them out . . . .	0

Absolutely the most disgusting , rude , ignorant , stuck up pricks my husband and I have ever dealt with ! Came in to buy a truck that we saw online and it was there parked out front of the dealership . We sat in it and looked at it in person , but when we went inside and talked to the manager he said they did n't have the vehicle we wanted to purchase hummm . . . . so of course my husband was pissed ! We left , but had to go back to get his license that they had kept . My husband showed some douche bag at the front desk there the online ad for the truck and said maybe if the sales guys / managers knew the inventory they could 've sold this truck today and the big nosed asshole said oh do n't worry about it we have plenty of people that walk in here every day , oh ok fu pricks ! We will NEVER EVER STEP FOOT IN THIS DEALERSHIP EVER AGAIN ! This place has the worst customer service , nasty attitudes , no common knowledge and think they 're better than everyone ! Oh well your loss our gain because I be damn if I want to give this place a penny of our money ! ! ! Think twice ! !	0

For us postmenopausal women , losing weight can be especially challenging . It seems as though our bodies are determined to cling to every ounce of fat . I previously tried raspberry ketones , with no improvement . However , garcinia cambogia really does help ! Of course , it does not remove the need to choose good foods in moderate amounts , and to exercise , but I have found it helpful in getting stalled weight loss back on course . I am happy to recommend this product .	1
The reviews for this product as a CURE for Heartburn and GERD were so enthusiastic across the web , that I really held out hope that this was IT .I even ordered the item NEXT DAY DELIVERY .Took it at dinner with a medium sized pork chop , broccoli , and a few small potatoes . Within an hour my chest was on fire . The worse heartburn I had , had in months . Nothing relieved it . Not Tums , NoReflux or Zantac . It only resolved itself the next day at about 3 pm .Be careful with any product containing HCI and Ox Bile if you have Acid Reflux . I wish it had worked .	0
something seems to have changed with the way fandango presents movie listings . i used to be able to print out the movie listings for our town so i could take them to meet friends and we would decide which to see . now the printouts are garbled and useless . the msn site still does listings very well . it looks like you do this to discourage people who are not actually going to buy a ticket through you . unless you add a functioning listing print feature , i will no longer use fandango . thanks , gary munson	0

Upon receiving this item , I was excited , I was looking forward too being able too have extra battery 's too swap out when my phone died .

What were they thinking ? ? Nice Phone , but ONLY 500 MB available on phone for Applications NOT 4 GB .The internal drive is factory partitioned to only allow 500 MB for apps ! Other BLU phones in this price range that I have encountered usually have at least 1 GB available .This is a paltry amount of available memory for an android phone . I only realized it on the phone when I ran out of space to install apps the first day I had it , and then called BLU support , who verified it , because it was hard to believe . Not half as much as other similar BLU phones I have encountered . Amazing because it has very few Bloatware factory unremovable apps on board .Apparently BLU engineering designated other RAM memory just for photos and the like . Why would the do this ? Could n't get my all my needs apps to fit ! ! ! Other BLU phone in this price range have at least 1 .0 GB available and that is also paltry , but manageable for many people for whom I set these phones up .There are definitely other Blu phones with more memory available and on paper the specs look the same , but againThe ONLY to find out before you buy it seems to be to call BLU Support first . They admit that these are unpublished specs . As of May 2014	0

Jason Shirley is a douchebag . He needs some proper home training . This happened to my wifeSorry for the late text , but I just wanted to share with you that I did buy the Kia today , as was my intention . Hopefully you will share the experience of today with your General Manager . Jason singlehandedly stood in the way of you selling me a car . The sad part is that when I confronted him about the ridiculous decision of not honoring the price while I picked up my kids he blamed YOU . Throwing a subordinate under the bus to protect himself is evidence of terrible management skills . I 'm so sorry you have to work under him . . . . you deserve better . You were honest and professional with me but unfortunately knowing the management style that Gunther Kia has exhibited I will never ever take my business there and will forever share my experience with whomever has a listening ear . As I said before I left , I fully intend to thoroughly explain my experience via email to the General Manager and how the loss of an easy sale was due to Jason 's pride and colossal immaturity .	0

Pros Cleans pretty well around the gum line Long charge Carrying caseCons Retraining how you brush Grows fungus inside Hard to cleanRecommendationSonicare Hx6510 Better handle and head designOral B Pro Care 1000for better scrubbing without the ultrasonic tickle .NarrativeThese work fine , but it 's there to show off inductive transmission .The head is not waterproof , and can only partially be dismantled without breaking it .The head will build up mold and mildew on the rubber parts , and goo / crud / fungus on the plastic and metal parts .You can clean this to a point , but ultimately , you have to replace the heads , not because of the bristles , but because of the unsanitary growth inside .Except , replacing the head does n't sanitize the handle . The handle has crevices for drainage of handle goo that will fill with fungus also . These are small and thin and can not be cleaned . As such , the handle will always be unsanitary .If you soak it in bleach , the internal rubber seal will eventually fail . This could lead to a battery explosion hazard .As such , consider this design the Essence and the Elite to be disposable . Clean the heads deeply every 3 months , replace every 6 months , and replace the handle every 2 years .	0
I see a lot of complaints about the size . How big did you people want this bag too be ? It 's a shoulder bag , not a backpack . It does n't look like a duffle from the pics and does n't say it 's huge from the description . Make wiser purchases . It fits my camera , 2 lenses , external flash , extra batteries , cables , hood , whatever else I put in there and there 's still room . As far as the padding goes , I do n't plan on tossing my bag around or slamming it against things so I 'm cool with the thickness . I wanted a sleek camera bag to fit everything I needed to bring except my tripod and I did n't want it to look like an ugly old camera bag not just because they 're ugly but because everybody does n't need to know I have a camera on me . This bag is great . There 's enough padding between the sections so the items do n't clank against each other . One of my favorite amazon purchases by far .	1

Overall the case is really below average and not worth the steep price it 's being offered at . If you insert cards into the slots , they make contact with the screen and scratch it in a matter of a few hours . During the first few weeks , it is difficult to take the cards out . I had to remove 2 cards so that the remaining cards could be removed easily . When all slots are full with cards , the cards at the bottom closest to the phone when closed tend to scratch the screen the most . Fortunately I had a screen protector so the screen was safe .I am not pleased with this case and think there are several better options at a fraction of the price here .	0

Mini did a great job on identifying my problem . I was well informed by Robert my service advisor . Unfortunately , I was not able to get my car programmed to cease showing I need an oil change when in fact I do not . This is due to the fact that I have exceeded the number of oil changes . However the good part about all of this simply means mini countryman cars are great vehicles . I have 241 . 000 miles . If you take care of them , they will run for a long time . Robert and the staff investigated my issue and did not charge me . I am grateful for the diligent efforts to help keep my mini runningThanks Robert	1
Love this thing . . . replaced my motorola headset with this after losing the second one again . Range is good , mic quality and noise cancelling is decent and battery time is EXCELLENT .

Well my experience was the worst of 5 different bmw shops I have used . It started by waiting 10 days for an 18k service . That is usually a 6hr job and I would have the bike back that evening . So I dropped bike off night before . Next day I find out that they do n't have a valve cover assembly . Ups next day , right . Wrong they drove to Denver the day after It did not arrive . Then the phone call . Mine is the first ever to need just one valve adjusted . That will be 2 . 5hrs more at 99 dollars an hr . So , they do n't have the part , again ! Quitting time 6 days later the 6 hr job is done with a bill for 9hrs . I would never recommend this place for anything . As a matter of fact I reported them to the better business Bureau .	0
If you need a brace to hold your thumb in against your hand this works . It has velcro straps that you have to play with but you can adjust it to hold your thumb where you want it . I 've washed this guy dozens of times and it is holding up well . I tried other hand braces but for thumb problems they did very little if anything . My thumb is better but I still use this for driving and other activities that I know stresses those thumb tendons . This is a nice brace .	1

I love these New Chapter Woman 's vitamins , just as I loved the New Chapter Perfect Immune ones I had . The woman 's ones are oneaday , as opposed to the threeaday immunity ones , so that makes them more economical , but harder to swallow . They are like the size of the big red OneADay Multivitamin / Mineral vitamins . I find warm tea makes swallowing tablets much easier than cold tea or Pepsi . Do note that 100 of Vitamin A in these woman 's vitamins and the Perfect Immune ones is as betacarotene that 's very important when you hit middle age . Unfortunately , the New Chapter vitamins are much , much more expensive than what many people will spend on daily vitamins , however . That is their only drawback .	1

This is the most comfortable nightguard I have ever used . In fact , it 's the only nightguard I can use without feeling like I 'm chewing on a giant hockey puck . However , you MUST be a person who is a light grinder , meaning you tend to chew from side to side instead of biting hard while sleeping . If you 're one of the latter types , this is not the nightguard for you as you will chew through it in a month or less .One way to determine which type you are is whether your jaw muscles are sore when you wake up . If so , you 're probably going to need to find a different nightguard . This is why the claims tend to range from people who love it like me to people who easily chew through it and give it bad rankings .	1

Love it or hate it . I hate it . I read 900 reviews on this HRM before buying it . After receiving it , I read all the negative reviews again trying to find a clue as to why the darn thing did n't work . I 've tried every suggestion posted in the comments of the negative reviews . Nothing worked . I do not give up easily , however , after two weeks of watching my heart rate go from 135 to 65 in the middle of my routine , after I 'm soaking wet , and staying there for the duration of my 1hour workout , I surrender .Based on comments in the negative reviews , it seems that a number of folks believe that any customer who has a problem with this product is either lying , stupid or both .Rest assured , their day is coming . What goes around comes around .I've used HRMs for over 20 years and got excited about being able to change my own batteries .My exercise machine is a VitaMaster AirMax II with the shoulderhigh , pump action handle bars that work with the pedals to spin an airresistant front wheel . I have it mounted on a platform with large rubber casters so I can easily move it all over my 90foot basement . Location is not the problem .Mounting the receiver on my wrist or handle bars does not help . Turning off all electrical devices does n't work . Working out bare chested is not the answer . Bathing in conductive gel gets me nowhere . A new battery was no better then the original .I even mounted a section of a foam pool toy to elevate the receiver directly in front of the transmitter , and at the same time , eliminate vibration from the machine . SEE UPLOADED IMAGE . NO JOY .I do know that some mechanical items can emit radio signals . Years ago , I knew a family who had new floor length curtains installed over their massive windows . They opened and closed the curtains with a long cord channeled over pulleys . Every time they opened or closed their curtains , the TV changed channels .My VitaMaster might be emitting interference . That 's too bad . It 's a good machine . Then again , the 179 customers who posted negative reviews on the Omron HR 100C might be correct after all . Imagine that .Let 's make that 180 .	0

So , several years ago when I lived in Vegas I used to hook up with this girl that had extremely bad B .O . but , she was really good in bed so I tried to deal with it by just trying to keep her arms down during sex . At the time I always assumed she did not use deodorant since she was kinda hippyish / into natural ingredients and I never went to her house because she was in college and lived at home .Fast forward to 3 years later and I was in Vegas to enjoy the Super Bowl and betting with friends . My last drunk night I texted this old fling and ended up getting picked up by her and stayed the night at her house for the first time to hook up with her . So , still the great hookup but , still the same bad B .O . Well low and behold when going to the bathroom what do I find on the counter ! the worst product in the world ! ! Tom 's of Maine unscented deodorant ! I even asked her in the morning about the product and she said she has used this since I have known her ! So much can be explained by this product and probably has cursed her life with bad Body Odor and scared off so many guys .	0
Even though the car had to be towed to service I 'm still happy with it 's overall performance . With that being said service is absolutely terrible and I am currently taking a cab to and from work since they did n't have a Loaner vehicle available . I did n't just want to buy a luxury vehicle , I wanted to buy the service that came with it . The additional 150 I pay per month for additional coverage is useless , makings this the dumbest lease agreement I ever did . At this point they can keep my 5 , 000 down payment , I just want out of my contract . Total buyers remorse , do n't do it !	0
I love this case . It does n't add too much bulk and it has taken a beating and my S4 is scratch free . It slides in and out of my pocket very easily .

All the holes line up perfectly , it has a nice lip that prevents that phone from falling directly on the screen or camera lense . Great case ! ! !	1

The interior seams are buckled , and misaligned . Some of the nylon stitching is heat shrunk and causes a very sharp seam / ridge on the tongue . They rubbed my foot / toes raw on an easy 3 mile run . Additionally , they simply do not fit my feet . The curve of the toe box is a bit extreme and I do n't think that going to a wider shoe would even help .BL They do n't work for me and the build quality is poor . Less than what I 've come to expect from NB .	0

I 've accepted I have persnickety feet . That 's why I started buying more expensive shoes .Imagine when I went to put these one and after 3 minutes , my toes were asleep . I wear a 10 to 11 in most shoes , but I 'd definitely have to size up for these . They were n't cute enough to warrant that . Back to Amazon they flew .	0

I 'm recovering from a total gastroectomy stomach removal and this pad holds the key to my being able to sleep . It is a soothing heat that relaxes my stomach and allows me to sleep .

It sadden me to report the poor customer service I witnessed with this dealership . I was on the phone with one of my closet friends as she explaining the threating treatment she was receiving from this dealership . As she was explaining her experience the manger came after her and a very threating and overbearing matter . At that time she was outside of the dealership standing in the parkinglot . As I overheard everything this man stated to her I found myself very upset . Not only should a man NEVER speak to a woman the way he did . Someone in the field of customer service should never treat a customer the way she was treated . As I was in disbelief I asked her to leave the dealership right away , as I felt that her safety was in jeopardy . Following this experience , she was harassed on social media from employees of this corporation . As a witness over the phone and to what I saw on social media , I question the integrity of this dealership DO NOT TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO MINI OF MONTGOMERY DEALERSHIP , you 've been warned !	0

what a worthless gift card . i have tried to use it at 2 different theaters and they either do n't take them or you have to go online to buy the tickets and then go to the theater to pick the tickets up , ridiculous . what if you spontaneously pass a theater and want to see a show ? you ca n't just hand them the gift card they wo n't take it . give me an amc card any day over fandango .	0

Then these are the clogs for you ! Thought you had enough aches and pains after a 12 .5 shift in the ER running around all day and logging a few miles pushing gurneys to CT , MRI Xray departments ? Back aches from bending over throwing in NG tubes , Foleys IVs all day ? Worn to a frazzle from that pesky expectation that you can divide yourself up and be in 5 places at once ? Well , your troubles are over with thses clogs ! Your feet will be in such abject pain by end of shift you 'll not even notice that aching back , that hand that was cramping up from charting will scarcely be remembered . Even that mindnumbing pain from a collegue accidentally rolling a wheelchair into your shin will now be a welcome distraction from your painful feet . In the name of fair and equitable product review one must look for a silver lining here and I think I 've found it , after a couple of shifts in these clogs no matter how brutal you 'll only recall the foot agony as you limp out to the car . As they feel comfortable enough walking around the house you 'll not really get an idea until they have been worn to work by which time you really ca n't return them either . Yes , they look comfortable and rather cute but , again , if you like pain these are the clogs for you !	0

I 've been wearing Levi 's since high school in the 80 's as opposed to designer brands during the Disco days Era . From there I stayed with 505s / 501 's , RE cycled and then a series of various Levi 's styles through a 20 year period . Many I now have are considered collectors items never to be made again . This New addition was a must have for me . I like these so much . so I 've ordered several pairs directly from Levi 's , since the Dep . stores rarely carry certain styles . I like this fresh updated style . These fit and feel great .	1

I had a sinus infection that turned into a cold as I got better . I was uncontrollably coughing and I 've tried different types of medicines . I mainly just had dry coughs and a bit of chest congestion so I did n't really need the other stuff that my cold medicines covered like nasal congestion , fever , etc . I was taking a Robitussin DM that does n't expire til Sept . of this year but did n't feel it was working . So I went to try other cough medicines . I tried Delsym which claims to quiet coughs for 12 hours and it did n't . In the end I returned to Robitussin DM by buying a new bottle . I immediately noticed that the new bottle was more liquidy than my old bottle which was a thick syrup . But it definitely works and quiets my coughs immediately . I will still cough but maybe once or twice every hour compared to every few minutes . The directions states to take every 4 hours and it 's the truth . My coughs are quiet for the entire Four4 hour coverage and soon after the Four4 hours up my coughing becomes uncontrollable again til I take my next dose which again immediately stops my coughing . I 've taken Robitussin for most of my Life since I was a child and I 'm glad to know that even know as a grown adult Robitussin is still the one to keep it 's promise in helping you feel better . I 'd definitely trust Robitussin both Past , Present , and Future ! ! Thank you Robitussin !	1

I decided to try out theanine not too long ago because I heard it can help take the edge off and help with concentration and for the most part I think I can say it does to an extent . I take it at least once daily but often put a bit into my workout drinks loaded with amino acids and so far I think it has helped reduce a bit of stress in me and kept me more on point throughout the day . I can not say for sure if this is true or not , mental well being is much harder to quantify than physical fitness , but if you are waffling on whether to buy it or not I highly suggest giving it a shot because you really wo n't lose or risk anything with theanine . And of course like anything else bought from BulkSupplements the quality and value is unbeatable . This is not only a great price but every product I receive from them is packed in minimalist packaging that is well sealed which is a very big plus . Nothing is worse than paying for some flashy label , or receiving a product that has a broken seal with all of the powder all clumped up inside . You can expect nothing but high quality from BulkSupplements .	1

I got these boots 1 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard . These boots are literally harming my feet . I am hurting every night when I come home and you can see where they are harming my feet , they wo n't bend at all . Breaking them in is n't the answer , I have tried everything .

Just drove off with my new 2018 Sonata SE . A friend had recommended this dealership , and Michael Vu specifically , as the one their family trusts . Michael Vu was able to give me a solid price . He 's been working there 12 years so that says something . Paperwork was fast expert and efficient . Michael is a low key , no pressure guy who knows his stuff . His direct number is 408 691 8497 . Saved me a lot of time , trouble , and hassle . I had looked at the Accord and the Camry . Toyota really dropped the ball by being one of the few manufacturers to not offer CarPlay / AndroidAuto . That does n't fly here in Silicon Valley . The great thing about the Sonata is even the base model has backup camera and blind spot detection . With their competitors you have to fish around for a higher end model and / or a safety package to protect your family . Hats off to Hyundai for just making it standard .	1
Staff was indirectly very rude at us , questioning every reason why we ca n't take the car on the same day .	0

Do n't even think about getting any other thermometer for baby . Ok , get one for the ear so you can take a temperature without undressing . But this is the fastest , safest , and easiest baby thermometer out there . It 's so so fast . And it 's completely accurate . There are no downsides . It barely goes into the baby 's bottom , but it still gets a lightning fast read .Absolutely one of my favorite baby items . This thermometer and piyo piyo baby scissors are the must haves that I give to my friends who are expecting a first baby .	1

At the risk of oversharing , the only thing this product gave me was severe constipation . I had to take something to reverse it , and now , well , let 's just say I ca n't leave the house . I am disabled from Crohn 's disease so I can get these symptoms on my own , without having to waste money , thankyouverymuch ! I am truly glad for the people it has helped , though .I ca n't stress enough that , before you start taking ANYTHING new , whether it be probiotics , vitamins or whathaveyou , CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR FIRST . Just because this is not a medication and is made of natural substances does n't mean it is good for you . After all , poison ivy and rattlesnake venom are natural , but they 're definitely not good for you ! Certain stomach conditions could also be exacerbated by this .If you are on an antibiotic , wait a few hours before taking this . Otherwise , the probiotic and antibiotic will cancel each other out and neither will work .If you have recently taken a round of antibiotics , especially if you 're a woman who has recently has a yeast infection , definitely see your doctor about taking a probiotic to reintroduce good flora into your system . Antibiotics frequently cause yeast infections .	0

I tried this bra on as soon as I got it in the mail , and not only did the size feel like it was already too snug even before I finished fastening the hooks , but as I was in the process of fastening the many hooks in the front TOO many , which makes it more inconvenient to put on ! , I noticed that the bottom hook was ALREADY BROKEN before I could even get it attached ! I opted to return it immediately and get my money back rather than exchange it for another one , since if that was an indication of the quality of the bra 's construction , then I 'm not willing to be foolish enough to give them another chance to unload their shoddy , illmade merchandise on me ! I will try another brand of support bra instead !	0

I have allergies and for the past few months I could not get over a sinus infection . I started using xclear nose spray which helped me but it made my nose even more dry and then I got those hurting annoying crusties in my nose . I tried humidifiers and saline spray nose irrigation and they only temporary helped me in these winter months . I have been using this a week just in time for an airplane trip I took . I used half of the dropper line in each nose then I took a q tip and dipped it in the solution and applied it to each inside of my nose to clean and soothe . First I got relief from the pain and soreness . Then the crusties started to go away and I can breathe more clearly . No more nose bleeds either . I apply this once in the morning and then again in the evening . Miracle stuff for me . I do n't see any green mucous anymore when i blow my nose . I will keep using it although the bottle does n't last long .	1

Firstly , I feel obligated to acknowledge the outstanding customer service I received at Best Buy , for once in my life it was n't some teenager in a blue shirt with no idea what they were talking about .As for this headset I got ta say I never expected that such a quality sound was capable through bluetooth 's limited bandwidth . This is most certainly a result on the inear design , which as a cyclist I appreciate no wind noise . The fit is fantastic and I love all of the fit options especially the attachable overtheear hooks for rides . I have n't had any problems with sweat and these seem super helmetfriendly . My only issue , for which I 'm not deducting any points for because they 're pretty upfront with it , is the poor antenna and weak battery life . I have to applaud Motorola on the S10HD , it gets twice the battery life 810 hours vs 56 hours and three times the range . Unfortunately Jaybird has it all over Motorola in sound quality .There is an issue I hear quite a bit about concerning the length and constant movement of the cord when the person using them is running , but I was able to fix this by looping the cord over my ears similarly to the design on the S10HD works like a charm .	1
I believe this shirt is responsible for the demise of Kennedy , Elvis and Archduke Franz Ferdinand who has three names . It 's all about threes .

I never had much luck with any of the standard joint pain products with glucosamine as the base ingredient , no matter what the other ingredients were . After spending countless dollars trying different products I read a study about how glucosamine does n't work for most people . I set out on amazon looking for a glucosaminefree supplement and found newjoint . I noticed the change in the pain on the first day although I ca n't really say it went away right away , it was very noticeable . the real results came after the first bottle and I was thrilled to say the least . I ca n't tell you how nice it is to go through my day and NOT think about soreness , stiffness , or joint pain ! Its something I now recommend to my friends , as we are all breaking down with age , ha , ha !	1

Packaging Simple . Not much to discuss , nor does there need to be .Usage Charge time 5 .5 hours using New Trent Charger NT90C3 .7 charges of Razr Droid that has a 1780 mAH battery1 .2 charges of a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10 .2 that has a 6800 mAH batteryAll in all , excellent charge capacity .In comparison to my Anker Astro 3E 10 , 000 mAH external batteryThe Anker unit is a bit smaller and lighter .Anker 3E weighs in at 229 gNew Trent weighs 236 gIn terms of the feel of the units the Anker unit has a very solid feel while the New Trent powerpack has a slight compression of the unit when you pick it up . It feels less solid . This is not a big problem , but it is noticible .The cable for the New Trent unit fits very securely in the micro usb port on both the cell phone and the tablet I used it with . On the other hand , the standard cable that comes with the Anker doesn8217 t fit as well , but does come with different tips for use with iphones .Anker turns on automatically , no button to push to turn it on . Not much of a difference , but I do worry about leaving cables plugged into the Anker unit and shorting them out accidentally .Another difference is the Anker unit comes with a carrying pouch which is handy for stuffing in a charging cable .I use battery packs for when I am playing the game ingress on my phone . This game consumes a lot of power using the GPS and data transfer constantly , so having a battery pack is a must for any serious game players .I would rate this as a 5 out of 5 . This unit is significantly cheaper than the Anker which makes this an excellent battery for the price . All of the very small advantages of the Anker unit carrying pouch and charging cable are more than offset by the higher capacity and lower price of the New Trent unit .	1

I have had these for 3 months now . I rotated between these batteries and the stock battery . They all had fairly equal use . After 2 months , the first battery started to expand and bloat . Now , the second battery is bloating and the first has bloated so much that it wo nt fit without pushing my screen out . These batteries have never worked with NFC payments . I tried a couple of times with ISIS unsuccessfully . Then , I rooted my phone , installed Google Wallet , and tried once with that . I have never had a successful payment with these batteries and I have never had a problem paying with my OEM Samsung battery in place .Also , the charger takes 8 hours to fully charge a dead battery . I 've been told by Anker that it 's my fault for expecting anything else because the amps are clearly listed . Who reads 0 .5amp and immediately know that this charger requires half of day or an entire night to charge 1 battery .After my first negative review , Anker made several attempts and correcting the situation . They offered to refund some of my money or send me a new charger . I 'm assuming that their customer service is the only reason there are n't more negative reviews . Like Tommy Boy said , If you want me to in a box and mark it guaranteed , I will . Anker has done just that .	0
The Dove Clean Tone advertises that it helps restore skin to its natural tone over time . It takes some time but it actually does work . I was not aware that my underarms could be lighter until Dove came out with their previous tone lightning deodorant . For me , it took about an entire bottle but my underarms actually looked better after using . From reading what others have said on Dove 's website , it takes about 3 months to see desired results . Underarm tone is not a major problem for me but it 's a nice product to use in the summer time with sleeveless tops and dresses .	1

I 'm going to be reporting Beverly Hills Porsche to the Credit Bureau because Randy disclosed confidential credit information to a mutual friend of ours in the text and will be exploring my legal options , as well . Just to note , the GM did n't even make him apologize for the text , proving what a lowclass organization that they run . I 'd recommend staying far away from Beverly Hills Porsche .

i was horrified when i landed on a fandango 404 page and saw this copy oh my , this is awkward sorry , sweetie , but something has done plum gone wrong . first of all , i hate being called sweetie . second of all , this is just bad , condescending copy . it 's insult to injury . just be honest , use straightforward language , and let users know what 's going on . you do n't have to be cute it 's just annoying . landing on a 404 is frustrating do n't make it worse by making it a brand experience	0

this is the second time i have come to check the balance on two different cards and could n't even get my balance . the first card had 3 different numbers so i could understand that but the second only had 1 set and yes i double checked i am sure i am not the only person this has happened to . hope the problem does n't occur again i would hate to stop buying or recieving the gift cards , because they are nice to have . but if you ca n't even check your balance online what is the use in having them .	0

Product provides no support for the thumb . The thumb is still flexible so that you can bend it towards the palm of the hand . The purpose of a stabilizer is to provide support to alleviate movement to help relieve the pain . This is not a stabilizer as there should be be metal on both sides of the thumb not 34on the backside of the thumb34 as this product has it . Worthless .	0

I do n't enjoy taking vitamins . I can usually get down capsules okay . Taking a multiple vitamin has always been challenging and I usually start forgetting to take them . Since discovering Source of Life Gold Chewables , I finally remember to take my vitamin several times a day .It is tasty and chewable , so it goes down very easily . It has just about everything I need in it . I feel good and people tell me I look healthy so what more can I say . If you do n't like swallowing pills , like I do n't , you might want to consider this chewable . A bit more expensive , but worth it to me . Health is a priority .	1

Very powerful that charges my iphone at least 4 times . Lightweight and portable . The only con I had was the power button , where you have to hold the button in order to turn on .

First off , one of the most important things to note about this product is that it does not smell bad . Fish oil and other krill oil products often smell so bad that I ca n't even swallow them . I hate buying a huge bottle of expensive supplements only to find out that they smell so bad that I ca n't even get them down and end up throwing them all away . With this product I did not have this problem because of the type of capsules they are in . I originally bought this product to help me lower my cholesterol after a blood test informed me that my cholesterol was a little high . After researching this product a little more I found out that it can also help with PMS symptoms which is really great since I have to deal with those problems every month . I intend to keep using this product and I would highly recommend that everyone research all of the things that krill oil can help with and purchase this product .	1

Lost my trust . Took in my 2014 C63 for the 30k mile A service . After picking my car up from the A service , on the way home the low washer fluid message comes up . . . ok whatever , that s in the A service checklist but no big deal . Then the next morning the replace key fob battery message comes up . . . . wait a minute , I remember seeing be charged for a keyfob battery replacement . So now I sit here wondering what else was not done on this service ? Was the oil even changed ? I do nt know , not really a way to check . The only thing I know for sure is that they reset the service reminder , and did a state inspection .	0
as soon as i got this sweeper i plugged it in and let it charge for a full 24 hours before i used it . when i went to use for the first time i got about 15 minutes of cleaning out of it on a hard wood floor and it just died . let it charge for another 24 hours and tried again and same thing happened . why spend money on something that only works for 15 minutes at a time ? i have a decent size house and it takes longer than 15 minutes to clean all rooms . i gave this to my mother which has a much smaller house with less rooms and she still do n't have the time to clean all 4 floors with this . She just threw it away . What a waste of money . Find something better .	0
After purchasing 2 different OEM batteries for my HTC Mytouch 4 G I decided to try nonOEM . The OEM batteries I bought here on Amazon and were listed as 34new34 . Both times from different sellers did I receive the battery only to find that the battery was clearly not new . It had scratches on it and certainly looked used . Battery life was not much better than the one it was replacing .The Anker batteries not only work well but is a very good deal compared to the 34new34 OEM ones . I can get through nearly two days of standby and a full day of light to moderate use before needing to charge . The instructions included with the battery were also helpful , such as the recommendation of not keeping the second battery in the charger for the best battery life . I will certainly buy the Anker brand again !	1
I normally buy Wanted brand shoes on amazon . But they were sold out in my size and after searching for days on amazon for a pair of black flats , I saw the glowing reviews of this pair and ended up purchasing them .Honestly the fit is weird . I am a size 9 Medium width and I ordered 9 . The shoe is too wide and does n't fit around the foot well . It opens up on the sides and looks like a bad fit even at first glance . I was thinking if I had ordered a size less than 9 , would it have been better , but then again the area near the toes would have been too tight as already the toe area is snug . So trying to go a size down to make one part of the shoe fit is not going to do it as the rest of the shoe will not fit well at all .This shoe is heavy . I am used to wearing only flat shoes and this is the heaviest shoe I have ever had .The shoe sole is VERY hard as though the heel is resting on concrete and only the area towards the top half of the foot is flexible .I have shoes that feel like I am walking on clouds but this one is not even close . I can not send it back as I paid for postage to get it and it will not be worth it to pay for postage to return . This will go to a charity and hope that someone else has better luck with them .	0

Jonathan Callahan was my sales rep in the purchase of my Hershy Mini . . He was very attentive to my needs and ended up matching me to a better fit than the vehicle I had originally come in to test drive . In addition , it was less expensive and he and his manager worked with me to create a winwin transaction between me and the dealership . There was no hard pressure , just helpful service . Everyone I came in connection with were friendly and enthusiastic . I have not had a better experience ! Go there , and ask for Jonathan first . . . o Kathy Hershy , Century 21 Top Producers	1

I 've had GERD for about 25 years . I 've been on every prescription med available and am currently taking Aciphex which barely helps . I tried this because of the favorable reviews and because I 'd done some online research and found that the active ingredient in Heartburn Free has been subjected to scientific testing and found to be beneficial to sufferers of GERD .It has not helped me . The recommendation is to take one pill every other day . When I do I get very painful flare up about one half hour after taking . I have been taking , and continue to take , a probiotic supplement . The probiotic did not work , either alone or with this product . I will discontinue both once the supply runs out .As other sufferer 's have gotten relief , I hope that I am in the minority and that you will get relief , too .	0
I bought my car back in February . Aaron was very helpful took the time and I got exactly what I wanted .

I like having this type of product as an add on . The fact it works great in my septic tank is a big plus . It recommends once a month , but I have extended the repeat after the first initial use .

I 'm sort of late to join the bandwagon , but I 'll commend the others for their spot on research , it pays to read the fine print and this is NOT Ubiquinol CoQ10 but an alternative without the main properties I as a statin user in my 50 's needs .

I purchased the Zadro Sunlight 365 Portable Light for Mood Adjustment approximately 3 months ago and have been using it as my secondary light source . I have a phase shift delay sleep disorder , so I use these lights in the morning as I 'm waking up and then as I 'm eating breakfast . I use the Nature Bright light with Ionizer however do n't care to use the ionizer as my primary light as it is a broad spectrum light with high intensity .Zadro claims that the Sunlight 365 is 10 , 000 LUX , however , this is not broad spectrum light , it is blue light , something I was not expecting when I purchased it for what then was on sale for 60 .I had read many reviews of this light before purchasing it , and bought it on a whim that I do n't really need to bother with the electronics for the alarm , which is hard to set , and will just be careful with the stand . I have been careful with the stand and it has been fine . Yes , it is flimsy , but manageable .The first time I set the alarm , I was in for a shock ! The alarm and light turned on at the exact same time . There is no way to have only the light turn on with the alarm feature . And furthermore , when I turned the beeping alarm off , the light turned off ! ! ! How idiotic is that ? Did I mention it took me 45 minutes to program that alarm with instructions in hand ? What is worst about this product are the electronics . They were designed poorly and perform poorly . Each time I try to turn on my light , I have to go through extra steps to do so . It has now reached the point at which no matter what buttons I press , the light will NOT turn on . So it has been rendered useless . I 've removed and replaced the battery several times to no avail .I was initially happy with this product , and possibly would have given it 4 stars because of its price , but now , I would give this zero stars if I could , because a product that only works part of the time should not be sold through a reputable company such as amazon .com .	0

It seems simple enough , but nothing else like this is available . I went through 3 other kinds of cell phone holders over the last few months before stumbling upon this . It 's not bulky , it stays put , it holds your phone the way it 's meant to , and the pivot options are pretty nice . The only thing that could make this product better is if there was an extendable arm that you could attach / remove as needed . Great product must have if you like to use your phone for navigation , etc .	1

I recently took my M3 in for a recall . I arrived at 7 am and waited for 15 minutes before the service representative saw me . I requested shuttle service and had to wait about 30 mins before someone was available . I was never called back to be notified my car was ready therefore I had to call several times to get the status of my car . I called at 3 pm and had to hold for another 10 minutes for the receptions to find out if my car was ready and schedule a pickup for me . I have been to the service shop several times and this has never happened . For the money your paying and the purchase price of your car I expect service well and beyond what you get here . It must have something to do with the vision of the new owner .	0
I was so excited to start using Vega , until I tasted it . I too hate to give this product a low rating just because of the taste . But I could not get past it . I even tried it with two 4 oz . Blueberry Yogurt 's and it still was bad . Very gritty , and just extremely hard to choke down . The artificial sweeteners in it are very strong as well . And the product has a strong earthy aftertaste .Just because the taste was bad , does not change the fact that I still believe this product is great . Just wish I could find some way for it to taste decent enough to swallow .A capsule form or something would be nice !	0

I got 3 slivers just taking these out of the package . They 're not sanded properly at all . The varnish is blotchy and the wood is not completely covered in the smooth finish .

Everything fits great about this shirt , but it 's just a bit too short from shoulder to shoulder . It 's not bad enough to be noticeable , but it 's a little more snug than comfortable .

I 'm struggling to get the initial folds out without an iron , I suspect this thing does n't wrinkle too much .	1

I have regular dry eyes from cold weather and lots of computer work . I normally use TheraTears , but I wanted to try the Similasan homeopathic product .The drops irritated my eyes they actually felt drier postdrops . I tried it at different times of day to see if that made a difference . It did n't matter , every time I had the same negative experience . The reaction surprised me . I figured as a homeopathic product it would either help or have no effect . I did n't think it would make the symptoms worse .The dropper style worked fine . It 's different than a regular eyedrop bottle , but it was easy to use .Note The product expires 30 days after the bottle is opened . Even if you do like the product , that is a really short use by period .	0
The dresses are very pretty . However , the size were deceptive . Although they are XL . They fit like a Small . Would not recommend for a full figured woman .	0
If you want to start riding or looking into buying a new bike , Cycle City is the place to go ! I went to Cycle City last year with absolutely no credit history and they still got me approved for a BRAND NEW MOTORCYCLE for a very reasonable interest rate . The staff if very helpful , knowledgeable , and most important , friendly and inviting . You wo nt ever see salesmen trying to steal customers or a sale . They all work together to get you the bike you want whether it be asking each other for opinions or clarifying specs and options for a bike . And when you are ready to make a decison , their finance managers are just as friendly and helpful . They are willing to work with you no matter what your financial situatuon may be . And they will be on your side when negotiating with banks and or credit unions ! They will get you a good deal ! Rich and Keprah are the best . I would highly recommend seeing Jimbo . He is very friendly and wo n't push you to any specific bike , but rather help you get the best bike for you . He is soft spoken and very humble . He will treat you with nothing but respect . No matter what the question or concern is , he will be there for you ! Jimbo helped me choose my first motorcycle . He also brought me over to the parts department and helped me look into some accessories and some gear that would make my would make my first motorcycle buying experience easy and stress free . And today Oct . 13 , 2017 I traded in my first motorcycle for another brand new motorcycle all with the help of Jimbo . He talked me thought the whole process of trading in the bike and how they would use it 's value towards the other bike . He answered every question I had . The process went as smooth as ever , from coming in to look at the bike a few days earlier , to working out numbers , and then to final delivery . He is the guy to see at Cycle City ! From when you walk in to Cycle City , you will be treated as family . You will get greeted at the the door by the cashiers , get helped with anything from parts accessories , gear , and yes , with buying motorcycle .	1

I 've had it about 3 months so far , and it 's looking great .If continues to perform this well , I may get another one in another color .	1

Because of the great price like a tenth the price of a LifeProof case , and some positive reviews I gave it a shot . The silicone housing is just not very well fitted . Loose in spots , too tight in others . The thing is that for just a little effort and no additional cost the manufacturer could have done a better job . Oh well .	0
1 . never got to see the movie i bought 2 tickets for due to a blizzard ! 2 . never got a refund due to fandango 's ridiculous policies and emails 3 . never , never , buying again and will tell everyone i know and more about this scam !	0
Great case , would recommend it to anyone . It fits the phone perfectly and also fits very tight . Seriously , but this case .	1

Traveled to Green Mountain HarleyDavidson today as part of a Seacoast HOG group ride through the foliage and covered bridges , starting at Seacoast HarleyDavidson . My bike had been making a squeaking noise , but I could n't get it looked at at home until next week . I swear the noise got worse on the ride today . I decided to talk to someone at Green Mountain when we stopped . Dana immediately had someone take it for a test ride and after a few , it was determined that the drive belt was too tight . The crew corrected that issue , checked my exhaust mounts , lubricated the belt and , in the process , cured that danged noise ! They did this in about 2025 minutes . We did n't even arrive at Green Mountain until about 430pm . I was back on the road by closing time at 5 . And I was n't even charged for the work ! These guys were awesome . Friendly , helpful , knowledgeable , professional and just all around great guys . Thank you very much ! My issue certainly was the end of the world , but you took care of me in short order and I really appreciate it !	1
I ordered a half size larger after reading other reviews . Despite that , I could tell immediately after putting them on that my big toe on right foot was up against the end of the shoe . Wore them for one day to see if they stretched out and became more comfortablenegative . Returned them . I do n't know if even a full size larger would have been enough .	0
what did you do to the website ? ? i can not easily and quickly the shows and times for napa . it use to show up automatically inn the top bar once you had entered the city . now it is just a bunch of ads and multiple screens to get through to find the napa shows . also , why on earth ca n't you give the program to 6 days ahead ( the following weekend ) ? people would like to make plans . such a joke ! !	0

Very poor salesman . Told us the showroom had nothing but used cars . Took up to roof . I had to walk up 2 flights . I can not walk well . Almost fell coming back down . Windy . Sun in face . Cars parked too close to get into . What do you want ? I did n't know . I wanted to be sold . We had visited Audi . Cadillac . Ford / Lincoln . All were professional . Cadillac took 2 cars out of the showroom for us to driveLincoln too took us for a ride . Audi was great . All had us in the showroom . Water ? Coffee ? . Comfortable . Lexus guy was totally not relating . Never offered us anything . Not comfortable squeezing between cars . Wind blowing . Sun in face . Could not get into cars too tight . No offer to drive . What a miserable experience . We thought Lexus would bebupscale . Refused to let us into showroom I almost fell coming down from roof . Really had no rapport with salesperson He was just an order taker . I am 76 and have bought many many cars in my life . This was a . mismatched experience . We immediately left and went to Audi . We got a new S5 . But what a low grade unprofessional experience at Lexus . Ford was even head and shoulders above . We were ready to buy but our experience was just low class low grade . Sorry Lexus . Even Martin Chevrolet provides a much better experience .	0

In every which way I can imagine , this bluetooth failed .I returned it back within minutes .Ear pieces all 10 or so did n't fit my ear , tapping twice did nt work answering calls , and since it did n't fit my ear , call quality was non existent .I promise you , I would n't take this Bluetooth even if it was free .	0
This product is billed as providing 34an invisible and breathable protective coating that repels water .34 Based on my experience , I can not corroborate this claim .Following the instructions on the can to the letter , I applied a thick layer of it on a couple pairs of suede / nylon running shoes and waited for it to dry . When I splashed water on my shoe , it beaded momentarily before soaking into the fabric . Thinking that this result must be the result of some peculiarity of our local tap water , I observed the effect of rain on the same shoes and found no difference . I thus conclude that this product does not work .	0
I m sorry Arnold but you should have tasted this yourself before putting your name on it . I bought it to try it out because it is cheap but I regret it . It taste very artificial , it reminds me of those muscle milk light ready to drink . It takes a lot of water 810 oz to make it drinkable but still thick . With Optimum Nutrition I can mix it with as little as 4 oz . I m currently on a bulk and my shaker contains protein with oats flour . With ON i can use 2 scoops with 2 .5 servings of oat flour and 1214 oz of water . It is not thick and taste great . I tried it with this muscle pharm and it became thick as pudding . It made my shake taste worse and undrinkable . I had to eat it with a freaking spoon . I am going back to ON for flavor , drinkability , and mix ability .	0
brought this for my grandson to go with his new iPhone , He was so excited to receive it , when I went back to their house a month later , he did n't have the lifeproof case on his phone . I asked him about it he said it broke the spring on it broke , I signed in to my Amazon account to see if I could get a replacement and it said the time for replacement had ran out . so I spent almost 80 .00 on a LIFEPROOF LOL case that did n't last 2months . what a joke !	0

dear fandango , my name is angel . i am a customer at your site . me and my family enjoy using your service . yet , now we are considering not using it anymore . my complaint is due to the lack of sympathy in your customer service , and the way payments are processed . recently , i made a movie reservation using my card . after the first try , i was told by the system to re enter my card information . i did so and got my ticket . however , i was charged twice by fandango . afterwards , i had a chat conversation with an agent named alphonzo . he told me this charge is known as a authorization hold . i never get these type of holds elsewhere . yet , i am short of 10 . 75 for 3 5 days and no solution for using fandango money that i need for other purchases . i believe fandango should not hold my money for almost the duration of a workweek due to a spelling mistake . customer service never offered an apology about the inconvenience , and seemed apathetic about the entire situation . thanks . i wo n't risk again .	0
I 'm not so sure about all the claims about antiaging personally , I do n't believe the marketing , but for reducing stress and just taking care of my general health , this product is great . Since I started using green tea extract a bit ago , my colds have stayed in hiding and I could n't be happier . And I 'm not too into yoga chanting or anything , so I use these to help me relax . I do n't have too many problems with my body I consider myself to be pretty healthy but sometimes the day just takes its toll , you know ? From work to family to friends and beyond , it gets a bit overwhelming sometimes , and so this green tea extract has really helped me get through those tougher days . That and a bit of light music and a quiet corner of the house . Oh , and these are decaffeinated , which is a must . Caffeine in a relaxation supplement ? I do n't think so . That 's like putting butter in a cake for the lactose intolerant . I do n't use this every day , but it 's nice to know that on the days when I really need to unwind for a bit that these are there to help me do it .	1
after using your site , i felt robbed . there was not an upfront mention of your convenience fee , and while i already had purchased the tickets for the price that it mention , after recieving my receipt was the first time i saw the added convenience fee . it ended up not being a convenience since we spent time in the ticket line , spent time complaining about it at the customer service office now spending time to write you letting know that putting your convenience fee should be in the total before purchase , giving the customer a choice to proceed with the transaction or not . i will never use this site again . my father was generous to pay for a large number of guests had an additional 13 . 75 tacked on that could have paid for two other childrens tickets . . we have learned our lesson . your web sight felt greedy sly . please make changes stop robbing potential long term customers !	0

It does n't remotely do anything it says the picture is misleading , the title is misleading , the concept is misleading . If you purchase additional receivers and attach them to your phone , then they will charge . Basically this is a sortacool looking but waytoobig multi functioning charger that is about as wireless as a showerhead . You can read the all the packaging and still not figure it out until you open it up , of course .	0

i will not ever use your service again . the service fee of 1 . 25 per ticket is ridiculous , and on the day i went the theater had a tuesday special that was cheaper than the price you charged me , even before the service charge . for the five tickets i spent an additional 12 or so between the overage and service charges . no thanks , enjoy the extra money you took from me because you wo n't be getting any more .	0
This product absolutely does not work . I purchased one from Amazon and my phone BARELY fits in it , and when I force it to fit , the casing itself presses on the buttons and causes the phone to lock up completely . Ca n't take calls , ca n't make calls , ca n't do anything .Without this Otterbox my phone is a great piece of equipment that I enjoy immensely . When I put my phone IN the Otterbox , it becomes a mere paperweight .I highly suggest you do NOT purchase this item .	0

Unethical , immoral and downright sleazy sales manager named Jimmy DeGelormo sold me a car 3 years ago with 3rd party financing . Looked at the car with saleswoman Ann , and was required to return the next day to sign paperwork with sales manager . Jimmy attached a 2500 used car warranty to the sales price , and told me that Wells Fargo , who was financing the car , required it to be purchased for used car financing . I purchased a 100 , 000 mile warranty for a car with 61 , 000 miles , assuming the warranty would extend to 161 , 000 , but in reality the warranty expired at 100 , 000 miles , which would have been covered by the manufacturer KIA anyway . In addition , Jimmy handed me a prefilled out waiver of gap insurance because he told me I would n't need it with the warranty I was required to purchase , since all major repairs would be covered . After speaking to Wells Fargo today , I discovered that Wells Fargo never requires the purchase of a warranty , and currently the engine is seized up at 115 , 000 miles in Petersburg , VA , and the warranty wo n't cover it . I called Jimmy , and he was not only unhelpful , rude , and condescending , but he admitted that he made a commission off the warranty , but not enough to make him rich , before he asked me why I was calling him ? and hung up on me .	0

I 'm not able to really review this product because I did not get the charging base as part of the Vine program ! But I can tell you that my opinion would probably not change much that this product needs a much better sleeve to have for me to recommend it . It does not protect your the top of your iPhone enough from an accidentally drop and therefor is n't a replacement for the Apple bumper case I normally use . And if it ca n't serve as a decent case that can replace my current case with , I ca n't justify losing the protection a case offers just to get away from plugging in a charger .	0
My car was fixed after three weeks of sitting at this dealership , I use my car to support myself to and from work so i have had to have the church help me being out of work for three weeks , there was a 1000 dollar deductible and this dealership will not work with me on the amount , instead say that i have to pay this amount to get my car released to me . I like most people live pay check to pay check and its hard on the little guy to make a way to pay this kind of money . I know i told them from the start that i would not have that kinda of money and was told we would cross that road when we got to it giving me false hope they would work with me on the amount . I even called the headquarters hoping to get some help and they of course sided with the dealership . Now i am faced with no car and soon no home because this dealership would not work with me or try . I hope that big guys like this can sleep good at night , knowing how bad they messed my life up .	0

I knew none of these alternative solutions at the time of being given 3 months to 3 years to live , so I looked on line with a Bible search engine every passage I could find on health found hundreds in both the Old New Testaments claimed those as my own , taking the Word like medicine Proverbs 4 . I have since learned the Lord has provided hundreds of low cost natural cures like this one no chemo or radiation needed both known carcinogens . I am SO grateful I was n't duped by the fearpromoting cancer industry .I had a football sized mass with 17 liters of ascites . The tumor grew from 20052009 when it was surgically removed and not one malignant cell found . My CA 125 went from over 100 to 7 with no reoccurrences since . How ? I am not advising anyone else this is simply what I do for myself , although it could change tomorrow .I stood on the truth in God 's Word that by His stripes we are healed Isaiah 5345 , 1 Peter 224 , Matt .817 .I also took AHCC , B17 , a mushroom blend , Vitamin C , Essiac , Beta Glucan , Fucodian , Curcumin plus the usual multivitamin , probiotic type supplements not specifically related to cancer . All of this I get on Amazon .I also do coffee enemas for my detailed routine , look under the newer reviews onB000PU6H4II eat organic as much as possible and have a green smoothie daily . I also use the GB4000 see Google .I still know it 's all God . Hebrews 67 says God sends the rain on soil that 's tilled . I want to do my part to ' till the soil ' while fully relying on Him to send the rain .I am also quick to turn back to His Presence whenever I veer away as well as forgiving since so much mercy has been shown to me .	1

3 22 14 as my husband and i went to feehold amc today to take my son who is in a wheelchair out to watch a movie , we were unable because it was sold out except for wheelchair space . fandango sold all the tickets including seats near the wheelchairs . do you think people in wheelchairs travel by themselves ? people with special needs are always discriminated against and now we can add movie theaters to the list . we had to turn back because we could not wait 2 hours for the next available movie . it was very disappointing because this is my sons only method of enjoyment . suggestion leave the seats on each side of the wheelchair open until 5 mins before the movie . i will be sharing my dissatisfaction to amc as well . signed jeanette a concerned mom . jfnurse81 aol . com	0
quite frankly , our son and family were visiting over christmas , and since there were five of us , we felt it was the only sure bet to buy tickets through you during the cold rain . iur daaughter in law was shocked that the fee here in redding , ca was higher than in l . a . ! ! ! all five of us attended 3 different movies over 5 days , but felt it was way overpriced , since you do not even assign seats .	0

Based on the listing , i was expecting this to be a bright , candy apple red color . In fact , it is much darker than shown online . This was the first problem that I had with the case . Then , just a couple of months after I got the case , I started to notice that the color was cracking off the case . CHEAP ! Wow . Things just are not made to last these days . I certainly did not abuse the case whatsoever . I would not recommend this case to anybody , except people I do n't like .	0

This product looked really really nice when I ordered it without trying it on first so I threw the packaging away and put the strapless body shaper in my lingerie chest . I was going to a very special event Friday night and I bought the item just for this event , so , I decided to try it on and it was absolutely a horrible fit . And , I ordered a size larger . I had to struggle with the straps , the crotch hurt badly as I tried to walk , while trying it on the bra did n't even reach my perky 38B breast . Maybe I ordered the wrong size , but it was so uncomfortable it hurt . The girdle hid very little and as I said the crotch part hurt badly , the bra pads were down to my waist I tried to adjust the straps NOT ! That did n't even help . What about some directions with this product . I hated it I threw it back in the chest with the tags still on and requested a return . So far , I have requested a return label from the Seller and still have not heard back . The customer service does n't seem all the great either , I want a full refund and they can have their product back . No , I would not recommend , and yeah , the panties are bikinis and show threw your clothes . Not cool at all ! I think I am going to leave online shopping to other people it is not for me . I have spent too much money returning items dealing with Sellers who do n't offer free shipping sucks ! Its not worth it for me to order online as the products I have received looks nothing like the advertised items online . That really sucks ! Marilyn Haywood	0

I use to order the Earth Circle brand spirulina but decided to try the Stakich brand for being organic and coming from Hawai . Earth Circle does n't mention anymore that their spirulina is organic . What a mistake ! When I opened the Stakich jar , a very bad smell came out and when I tasted the powder , I could n't swallow it even diluted in a large cup of water ! I know that all seaweed products do n't smell like roses . . . . . .but this one is really unbearable for me .So I contacted Earth Circle to find out why there spirulina was not branded as 34organic34 and they answered to me the following 34Our products that originate in both China and Japan are all thoroughly researched , tested and screened for any possible contaminants or radiation . ECO only accepts testing performed by qualified third party representatives . We require suppliers to provide tests from US laboratories or we have the products tested upon arrival34 .I ordered their spirulina again and am happy with it . So . . . .up to you if you want to try Stakich . May be will you like the taste ? ? ?	0

Perfect for neck pain . I used to use a frozen bag of peas , pop bottle with frozen water , rectangular gel packs , etc , but since this is formed to fit around your neck , it works great AND it can be used as a hot or cold pack . Definitely worth the money .UPDATE It 's now 3 1 / 2 years since I purchased this and I still use it . . .it has held up perfectly . The reason for the update is that I have had shoulder surgery recently and although not intended for shoulder use , the way it is shaped , it is PERFECT for icing a shoulder injury . It covers the top , front and back of the shoulder , icing the entire thing . In a way , I got 2 products for the price of one !	1

I bought this case and loved it from the beginning . Very cute , color popped , easy to put on and still nice to the grip . . . . . .within days I was having problems with the phone , the screen was going black when I was trying to make calls , I could hit the send button but as soon as I put it up to my ear the screen turned black and would not go back , so if I had to push any buttons for an extension it was impossible also impossible to hang up , I would have to use the power button and hit it like 20 times just to hang up the phone . After going back and forth to the phone company exchanging the phone cause we all thought it was a phone issue , a sales guy finally figured out that the case was covering a sensor at the top . Apparently there is a sensor on the front screen at the very top above the speaker right where the case was covering it and that 's what the problem was . So , case is very cute but unfortunately your phone wo n't work right with its sensor covered , so my advice do n't waist your money .	0

They look cute , but way too tight unless you have chicken legs ! I am 5'334 150 with thick legs and even though I tried to pull them all the way , they rolled and looked very unflattering . I ended up folding them over at my knees but it was still tight . Waste of money .	0

I 've been taking all sorts of things to try to sleep . I was even taking a magnesium that I bought from Walmart . When I addressed the issue with my doctor , he told me that the walmart crap does n't absorb into your body . He told me to find Magnesium Glycinate . Not only did I have trouble finding it , it was also quite expensive . I tried this brand out because it was the cheapest I could find by unit price .I use 1 / 8tsp per night mixed with a little water . I mix LTheanine as well and one of those do n't taste so great , but I 'm not sure which . I add a drop of lemon essential oil and it 's fine .I am happy to say that for the last week I 've finally been sleeping and it feels sooooo good . You should totally give it a try if you 're struggling with insomnia .	1

I 've used many cotton floor mop so microfiber mop is something new to me . I got the mop today so I used it to mop the entire floor and I have to say it was a pleasant mopping experience . The mop has a nicer feedback than my previous cotton ones while mopping . The description says that Microfiber is superior than cotton at picking up dirt , but I did n't notice a significant difference though . Overall , this is a very cheap mop that get 's the job done .	1
Went today with trailer in tow to buy a new Honda knowing they had one left after a brief call to sales . After trying to negotiate , and by that I mean throw in a helmet or a cover or SOMETHING to pitch in on their end , they said nope . Their setup and destination fees are higher than everyone 's and they hinge on the 200 rebate that the factory is giving back . . . not them ! They lost a sale over a 99 helmet that cost them less than that ! No problem . . . just put a deposit on one at the Honda dealer in homer . Over a 100 less including the 4 hours drive time each way in fuel and they are putting on a recoil start NO CHARGE ! That 's how you win a deal . Not by being an arrogant fool stating we just have no mark up . . . really ? Then how do you pay yourself a commission along with your salesperson ? Do n't bother with this place , waste of time .	0

I bought this bc of the serving size . You get a lot for a low price . It tastes disgusting . Has a minty vitaminy taste . You 're sposed to swish , or hold it in your mouth for 30secs , but wow . . . hard to do ! I also compared the vitamin amounts to my prev . vitamins and there 's almost nothing in here . I took double the serving and got no energy boost at all .

This was my headpiece for Pirate Night on a recent cruise . I like that it tied to adjust the size / tightness to my comfort . Along with huge gold hoop earrings and a wenchy style top over black slacks , I managed to pull of a look to fit the occassion without spending much money at all . This piece is the only one I probably will not get any additional use out of . . . but maybe I will find a way .	1

I ca n't plug headphones into the phone because the case that comes with this battery is too thick . In order to use headphones , I have to remove the case which leaves the phone exposed on the back .Also , the surface of the case is slippery , making it harder to hold especially with one hand or to grip onto other surfaces .I will say the battery 's life was as good as I would expect , but as a result of this case , I do not consider this product usable .	0

I 've used quite a few different safety razors 1 , 2 , 3 4 blades , 2 or 3 Remingtons and I 've also had one Braun . All of the safety razors caused a lot of irritation on my neck . The Remingtons Braun shaved very well when new , but after a month or so they all seemed to dull and give only a fair shave . This Panasonic , from day one gave a great shave , and after well over a month , the shave has not changed ! I 've tried using the shaver dry , but did n't care for it that much .I wash my face neck in hot water , rinse the soap off , and put on a thin coat of shaving cream I heat up the shaving cream for a better feel , not a better shave . On the neck I have to move the shaver in all directions , since my beard seems to grow that way . It takes me around 5 minutes or so to finish , rinsing the shaving heads now then to keep the shaving cream from piling up on the them .When finished , my face is smooth the shave is close , and there is absolutely no irritation . Is the shave as close as a blade ? I 'm not sure , but my face neck sure feel a lot better then they do after using a blade .Would I buy this razor again ? Without question ! Do I recommend it ? Let 's just say that it 's far better than anything else I 've ever shaved with .	1
As with other reviewers I followed the directions to a tee on this unit and can not get it to read a pulse on either males or females . The concept is great , having a monitor without a chest strap , sounds awesome . The execution , not so great .At this price point the features are seriously lacking compared to models with a chest strap , this unit 's features compare to a roughly 60 chest strap unit , but I guess one should expect to pay a premium for new tech .I tried looking for a firmware update at Omron and there is n't one yet . Going to their store and looking in the heart rate monitor category , does n't show this model listed . Likewise Amazon has it listed as Currently unavailable . We do n't know when or if this item will be back in stock .I will update this review should a firmware update become available or if I can ever get it working .	0

I am so bummed that it took me 3 tries to get this onto my phone , so it ended up wasting 2 of the 3 that it came with . The third one almost worked , but the edges refuse to stick even though it 's nowhere near the beveled edge . And yes , I followed the directions on the package . I used the squeegee to get all the air bubbles out and that worked fabulously . I love the how the most of the protector leaves space on the edges because it does n't come near to touching my cellphone case and that is why I bought this particular one . Clarity is amazing and the touch sensitivity is not degraded or affected .CONSDusty packaging ! ! ! The cardboard squeegee that this comes with has a lot of paper dust that attaches to all the other materials , so you have to dust off everything . Even still , the dust is impossible . I placed this on after cleaning my desk with clorox , using dust off and then using hand sanitizer before cleaning my phone 's screen .Another note is that it it 's hard to perfectly line up the screen protector so that it does n't overlap the bottom button , the cameras or the speaker . Somehow I got it right the 3rd time , but it 's only a matter of time before the protector comes off because the edges will not bond . Update The ONE screen protector that ended up working completely failed . I 've owned other screen protectors for other phones and did n't experience what I did . Absolutely do not buy this product ! ! !	0
I want to give an exceptional review to some very exceptional people NICK HADENFELDT , IDRIS OSMANI , EDGAR LOPEZ AND LEO STEFANI and the GENERAL MANAGER I did nt get his full name all at Premier Nissan Stevens Creek , San Jose , CA . I first went to Nissan Sunnyvale to purchase the Rogue SUV and spent hours there on a Sunday . The finance folks were ALL horrible ! They threw in all these charges thinking I would nt notice and when I did they would nt even let me hold the paperwork to see what exactly was listed . After doing my homework , I knew what I wanted and how much it would cost . They were trying to take advantage of me since I m a woman and I went in there all by myself . First they said I was approved at a low APR , and then it changed to a really high APR after I told them to remove all the additional charges . Then they said they were closing and it was too late to even call the banks for financing which did nt even make sense . How would they know what APR I would receive if they did nt even talk to the banks yet ? They said they would call me in the morning . So , I left with without buying a car . Then after 4 days of calling them to try and get the low price I had negotiated and no return calls , I called the general manager at Premier Nissan Stevens Creek . I told him what happened and he said to come into his dealership and promised that his team would take care of me . I made an appointment with NICK HADENFELDT Financing , who was so nice , upfront and honest about everything . He did nt rush or pressure me and he listened to my concerns and questions . He did everything he could to assist me in purchasing the exact car I wanted and even worked extra hard to get me the lowest APR possible . He really treated me with dignity and never made me feel like I was being taken advantage . He even ran the numbers with different options for me to choose from to make sure I could afford my payments . Then EDGAR LOPEZ took me for a test drive and was a very polite and professional salesperson . He showed me all the colors available and helped me pick one out . He even stayed late with the others to make sure everything went smoothly . Next I was sent to IDRIS OSMANI Finance Director I just loved him ! He made the hardest part of the process go as quick and painless as possible . The final price on all the paperwork was what we negotiated and there were no lastminute surprises . No games , no lies , he even found ways to save me more money in the end along with Nick . He made sure I understood every single charge listed . We even bonded over our love for our canine children . Finally , LEO STEFANI Sales took the time to show me how everything in my brand new detailed car worked . He even helped me set up the blue tooth with my iphone , etc . He took his time and answered all my questionsI could tell that all of these gentlemen were being EXTRA nice , kind and helpful because the general manager told them about my horrible experience at the previous dealership , but also because they are all genuinely nice people and that they cared about helping me . I just want to say thank you once again to all of them for the wonderful customer service , patience , respect , time and staying late , and effort in treating me like royalty that s how I really felt during the whole process . It turned out to be an exceptional experience and I even had a lot of fun hanging out with them that night . I REALLY LOVE my new car ! ! ! ! I have and will tell anyone that listens to go to Premier Nissan Stevens Creek and ask for NICK HADENFELDT , IDRIS OSMANI , EDGAR LOPEZ AND LEO STEFANI BeckyP	1

I ordered size 8 Frye Veronica Slouch black tumbled full grain . The color was at a discounted price . Perhaps it 's not a big seller because the hardware is more of a brushed brassy color and not silver . I got a steal at one hundred forty six dollars ! ! Way less expensive than my niece who works at a high end store and gets discounts on top of discounts ! ! I tried my size on first at a store and I knew size 8 would be more roomy than my usual size 8 boots but that is ok because I 'd rather have more room than not . I do notice some slippage in the back of my heel when I walk but I 'm sure this can easily be fixed with a heel insert or foot bed . They are completely comfortable ! ! ! I find some boots tend to be more snug in the width but not these they fit perfect ! I do have wiggle room for the top of my toes but nothing that is overly sloppy that I would say these boots are way too big . I 've read reviews of some saying to size up , some saying to size down My recommendation is to stay true to your size . As for the slouch . I have no problems with mine . They are a little 34crumbly34 if you will near the top instead of starchy stand tall but they do not slouch and fall like a loose sock or anything . Hardly even notice the slouch in my opinion . The leather is soft ! and that is why you get a small amount of slouch instead of buying a hard stiff leather boot . The 34tumbled34 appearance in the leather is a nice effect so do n't expect a smooth shiny black boot , but slightly pebbled grainy like a purse with texture . I 'm super satisfied . I 'm hoping with proper care these boots last a long time ! ! Also to mention as others have saidYes you do have to put a little 34oompf34 in getting your ankle / foot into the boot . I did not have to loosen the bottom buckle at all , it 's just stiff and rigid on the ankle shoe bed unlike the softness of the shaft . Not that big of a deal but do n't expect them to slide on like a slipper !	1

While a great idea , this product is not worth the money . First of all , every dryer vent entrance is different . The one shown on the box and in the infomercial is much later than lost . It also makes it appear the hose is a lot longer than it actually is . The hose itself is very stiff and does not reshape even with the use of a hair dryer as recommended . The two green wand attachments do n't stay together either , so if you 're not fighting with the stiffness of the hose and trying to redirect it inside the vent , then you 're stopping to reconnect the two green parts back to the vacuum wand . As others posted , a lot easier to take your dryer vent apart and clean than attempt any sort of cleaning with this useless product . Save your money !	0
I was fairly excited to hear about this product . While I do find the iPhone screen simple to use , I thought I could get some extra finesse with this thing .Well , finess is one thing it does not have . It is very light and there is a sort of conductive foam tip . This foam tip seems quite flimsy and I have no confidence it will remain attached for very long . The whole thing is put together with perhaps 20 cents worth of stuff and they have the gall to charge 15 or more for it .So to the functionIt take a great deal more effort to effect the screen than your finger alone . The screen really does not read it well and you have to push far harder than I am comfortable doing .The screen does recognize it eventually but really it 's flimsy tip is the problem in my mind .Overall not worth the effort or the fingers are free and work far better on the iPhone or iPod touch . Get a nice screen protector and you will be far happier .	0
I matched this scarf online with a dress I ordered online , so it was a total crapshoot whether or not they would match one another , but they did !

I had a drop off car appt . After 4 days and no return call from the 2 vm I left , I finally called and asked to speak to a manager who was on vacation . Several people then tried to locate my car and kept asking what color it was . The information provided at pickup still had the previous owner personal information on it even though I had provided my information several times . The car was serviced , but I 'm still trying to determine if the recall work was completed and why I could n't find out why the service engine light was on and once again find myself with no return call . Overall , a really bad experience .	0

I love this case . I bought it because I knew i liked TPU cases when I had my cheaper Android phone . Now that I have a more expensive one , do I still trust TPU cases to protect it ? YES . This case takes hits , falls , etc like none other , protecting my phone with shock absorption and preventing the screen itself from hitting the hard surfarce .I bought this with for making a custom phone case and it turned out phenomenally . The sticker / decal i designed sticks perfectly and I can peel off the sticker at any time to replace it as it fades . This cases was perfect for the project . I LOVE IT .BUY it . Best couple bucks you will have ever paid for a phone accessory hell , some ringtones cost more ! Best buy .	1

these pants were great for 2 times wearing them . then the next time i was wearing them i was in my car waiting for work and looked down and they were ripped right down the seam . i work in an emergency room and my stuff takes a beating , these pants could not hold up i guess . I Recommend the wink pants for men , i have had them for 2 months and there is no problem . Another thing wrong with these pants is that the draw string dose not stay tight . i constantly had to keep tieing them and my pants still would fall down . It came to the point that i had to have nothing in my pockets .	0

I bought a pack of these socks in XL for our son , who wears a 14 shoe . He 's currently wearing some Hanes XL , which fit his foot and calf perfectly . I had n't been able to find another pack locally so I ordered these .I was surprised when I took these out of the package and noticed how long and skinny they were , but I figured they would stretch when he put them on . However , he was n't able to get them past his foot ! I 'm not sure how they can call them XL when they would be tight on a little boy .I'm angry that Champion would sell socks this awful , and angry that I have to mess with returning them to Amazon . Do n't buy these unless you have legs like Spongebob .	0
Stay away from John in finance , he will take advantage of you especially if you are young . I had a 750 credit score and he still played games with me on interest rates . Also , the Mazda I purchased has been in for an oil change twice . First and second time I have found new scratches every time in the inside of the car after they had worked on it . Also , one thing that is also upsetting , the second oil change I asked my service writer specifically to not have my car washed I even reiterated it to the man many times that I did not want them to wash my new car and what do you know they washed my car . The number one way car paint gets damaged is by not washing the car correctly , the worse part about it is they hand wash your car here they do not have an automated wash .	0
My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters . These toe sleeves did not work for me . They slipped off the toe , they bunched up , they were not comfortable . After trying it for about a week I threw them out .I found a better solution that works for me . I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula .45 ozto put between my toes . They now glide against it each other rather than rub , and I do n't have any blisters .This saved me a lot of pain , I wish I knew of it earlier . I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem .Ali Julia review	0

As of yesterday , I became a first time car owner of a 2017 X5 BMW SUV . Now , here 's the backstory to this tale . It was between a MercedesBenz SUV and a BMW SUV . I had finished meeting with the BMW folks , I picked out a BMW SUV , and headed to the MercedesBenz dealer . While at MercedesBenz , from the beginning the appointment was a bit of a disaster . The rep I was meeting with said he did n't know I was coming , even though someone called me to confirm two days prior and confirmed he wld be the rep I would be meeting with . He actually seemed to be in a mood from the beginning . While , I was contemplating between the two SUVs , which happen to be the same color , range in price , etc . I asked god for a sign , while I was sitting in the Mercedes Benz SUV . I really did n't know which car to choose . I still gave a refundable deposit down to ensure I was able to get the MercedesBenz SUV next in line . Someone else before me gave a deposit towards the car and their timeline to pay the bill was coming up , this Monday . Little did I know that god wld send me a big sign . As I got out the MercedesBenz SUV the rep got a major attitude and with a dismissive tone loudly said , I 'm going to refund your money , since you ca n't make your mind up ! And , the rep began to storm off . Another MB rep was taken back by his behavior . I stopped the rep and said , What did you say to me ? I have never been treated or talked to like this ! Yes , all in MercedesBenz in front of everyone . The other rep who witnessed the incident told me this has never happened . I demanded to speak with a manager . The sales manger was very nice and apologetic . He wanted to take care of me and said he would handle the situation with the rep . I asked , that they just retrain the problematic rep . The manager wanted me to continue my search at Mercedes Benz . While , he said this kind of scenario has never happened , I told him , well it did and apparently it happen for the first time to a Latino man . Would the rep react in the same manner if I was a white man or woman . I understand , we all have our days at work . But , this man is getting paid good money to sell cars that sell themselves . And , I am one of the easiest people to deal with . The cultural sphere in the USA being polarized into two competing ideological positions infused with oppression , discrimination and a whole lot of racism . And , this incident was deeper than a disgruntle employee . I talked to the manager in a very respectful and professional manner , you wo n't have a receptive audience with screams and cursing . I finally ended with , I 'm leaving with my money and my dignity . I will never support MercedesBenz and I will inform others of this disappointing / horrible experience I had at MercedesBenz Manhattan mercedesbenz mbusaMorale of the story things happen for a reason and it 's up to all of us to not let any kind of treatment that is meant to make us feel less than , continue or happen without being challenged .	0

I work in Vancouver , and took a ride over to check out the shop during a lunch break , as I 'd never been there before . I was one of 2 ? other patrons in the store . Walked through the entire place , looking at tags , seeing what was in stock . Made eye contact with someone that looked like they might work there as they walked by me . Was never greeted , nor approached . Stood outside looking at a bike in the used area . Again , no one came near me . Got back on my potential tradein , and rode away . Wo n't return .	0

My Audi A4 is 4 weeks old and I ran into a pothole on the road , and both front and rear rims on my passenger side got damaged . After talking to my insurance , I sent it to the Audi Plano service center for repair . They said the rims had to be replaced and would cost approximately 2400 and take 3 days . I paid . I waited for 3 days , nothing ! Waited for a week and finally it was done which was as not posmised . When I took the car for a ride , I felt unusual vibration on the steering wheels , which I had nt experienced before . Since I was going out of town for a couple of days , I called and informed them about the issue before leaving . The agent informed me that I could take the car in anytime and they would look into it . After coming back in town , I tried calling him for several days and left voice messages to schedule repair . No response whatsoever . Finally he called back on the 4th day and I took the car again the next morning . When I picked up my A4 in the evening , they said that the vibration was a new feature or manufacturing problem for every Audi cars . The agent said , we have test driven few other Vehicle as well even they are same , I could n't accept it , but finally they confused and convinced me . I have no way to telling if they re implying I have no idea what a luxury vehicle feels like , but I ve driven BMWs , Infinity , Benz , and none had such a feature . Even my old Honda Accord was smoother on the touch than the new Audi A4 which I paid almost double for . After 1 and half month I 'm giving this review because I thought I get used it to or I thought it will get fixed automatically . But it 's going worst and I really do n't know what to do . I regret buying Audi A4 .	0

I have been using Cremo Cream for almost 12 years , but this was my first time to buy the product from Amazon . The product was an imitation of the original , the cream was lighter and the tubes were very cheap , they were the same size and same writing but the quality was like night and day . . . I ordered 3 and all three were broken from the top where the tubes were sealed .	0
I ordered these because I was looking for grey flats . When the shoes arrived , I wondered if someone had put the wrong pair of shoes in the box by mistake because the color is clearly not gray , but more like taupe or beige . This shoe is not available in taupe or beige on amazon so I think I was just misled by the picture on the website . I returned these because of the color issue .I did not have the sizing problems that others have complained about . I wear an 8 and found these to be true to size , but the toe box was tight . Had I kept the shoes , I think the toe would have been comfortable enough after a few wears , but the sides of the shoe by the heel are very stiff , and I suspect the sides would not soften with wear and would cause blisters .I do not have finger toes , but toe cleavage was still visible between all of my toes .	0
I received this today and I ca n't believe it is the same one advertised . My unit is not sheer or translucent in the back . It is a flat black nonseethrough . Also , the color is clearly not orange . My wife describes it as peach / pink , so I do n't think I 'll be using this . It does fit the phone properly , and the raised edge in front does keep the screen from being scratched when laid down face first on a flat surface . Other than that , I would n't pay more than 5 .00 for this very boring , cheap feeling cover .	0
I love the shirt , fit is good , could be a little larger if you like a really loose fit though . I suggest if you want as a layering shirt and you wear a medium size to get an extra large ! But , it 's soft and comfy , and it really like it anyway , not so small that I need to return it .	1

When I first opened the package , I could definitely smell some strange scent on the leggings like other reviewers described . It 's not terribly overpowering but , definitely give them a wash before wearing . Also , I am 5'3 and weigh 105lbs , I am petite and short . When I tried the leggings on the waist band had to be pulled up so high that the waist band sat about 1 inch below my chest ! I have other pairs that cover my belly button but , none of them have ever sat so high on my body . The only pro about these leggings is the fact that they are super warm so , if you are tall get a pair . If you 're anything like me , stay away .	0
After reading countless reviews of many products , I decided to go with the IMP52D .I previously owned a New Trent product for my previous iPhone 4 which I was happy with but lost it but I 'm pretty satisfied with this replacement .This product is great for anyone who is a heavy user of a smartphone or needs a bit of extra juice for their phone throughout the day . The IMP52D has a nice small form factor which is great since I can carry it in my pocket and not worry about my iPhone 4S dying . After 3 days of extensive testing throughout college and other activities , I get 2 full charges and about 5060 of another charge . The carrying case is great as well I know my keys wo n't scratch it .The IMP52D also has a builtin flash light and a red laser pointer but I have n't really used it much .The quality is great as it does n't feel like cheap plastic . It has a nice solid but smooth texture to it .The only con is activating the LED flashlight since it requires holding the button for 34 seconds while the laser pointer is only two clicks . Seems more reasonable to have quicker access to a flashlight than laser pointer but that 's just my opinion . But despite this , I still give it 5stars for the performance and quality .	1
The screen protector was of a very good quality , it took a while for a all the bubbles to disappear after applying the protector . Screen sensitivity was diminished a bit but appeared to return to normal after a week or or maybe I got used to it .Eventually , the protector lasted about one year before it started to peel off around the edges . Scratches were never apparent on it and my phone did endure some nice hits .Overall , very good quality .	1
Grabbed my nanoSIM and placed it in the appropriate microSIM adapter and it fit nice and snug . These adapters are precision cut and work flawlessly . No issues whatsoever with inserting the SIM card adapter in to the phone , once installed the phone works perfectly as you 'd expect , and removing the SIM card adapter were as easy as you 'd expect . Handy product to have !	1

This product is easy to use , most of the time , though i did encounter one bottle that did n't squirt properly at first . And it 's genuinely fragrance free it does n't have a masking fragrance . I really wanted this ecofriendly detergent to work , but after going through several bottles of the stuff I had to acknowledge that bra straps and shirt collars were decidedly grimy . It was leaving clothes dirty even though I was supplementing it with borax and baking soda . I now use Seventh Generation Powder Laundry Concentrated , which is also fragrance free but which actually works . Now our clothes are clean again .	0

Ok , so sticking true to my goal of chemical free and lowcost or free living , here is one of my fav beauty tools in my bag . After reading dozens and dozens of reviews , I put it on my Amazon wish list and received it for Christmas in 2011 .I was interested in this product because I hate tweezing , I 've been lasered NOT permanent as claimed , but does last a few months , electrolysis is too and painful , and , though I have my own hot waxing system , I have a very difficult time removing the fine hairs right under my nose and on my chin wax irritates me and causes breakouts in those areas as does depilatory cream . I was willing to risk someone else 's 5 .00 on this . Did I mention it comes with its own velvet pouch ? It took some getting used to , but after about four uses , I think I now qualify as a professional user of the Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool with FREE Black Velvet Pouch . Here is the link if you are interested in this cool little product http // www .amazon .com / FacialRemoverThreadingBeautyVelvet / dp / B001R8YUK0 / refsr11 ? sbeautyieUTF8qid1327580100sr11My nowexpert advice ? Bend it not quite in half , set it against the skin and twirl the spring at least two or three rotations in one spot , first one way , then the other , for maximum hair removal . Gently pull the spring apart I do not use the handles for this part too afraid they 'll break off and blow the hairs out . It will seem awkward at first to use this , but it wo n't be long before you , too , are singing this little device 's praises .After using , I swipe on witch hazel which is the best and cheapest astringent you can buy at about 70 cents a bottle until the cotton round is clean . No oil is left on your skin and witch hazel is soothing so no breakouts . Have fun ! Or at least as much fun as one can have ripping one 's hair out by the roots ! Gosh , I love being a girl ! Update August 2012 I 've been using this great little device about twice a week since I got it for Christmas in 2011 . I always blow the hairs out and rub it with a dry , lintfree cloth before putting it away and it looks as good as the day I opened it . I do not use this anywhere near my eyes , but for the removal of the rest of facial hair , it just can not be beat . The more you use it , the less it hurts as the hair is shorter . Pain is worse when the hair is longer . With regular use , the hair will never be long enough for anyone to see . Also , I never use a mirror as I use this . I go by feel , and I might have one hair to tweeze each week no joke . Love this thing , and still using my super cheap witch hazel to soothe my skin afterward .	1
These are not OEM , they are not stamped BLACKBERRY anywhere . but for 3 .50 , it does not really matter . What does matter is that the small microphone is so far from your mouth , some people can not hear you and you need to pick it up and hold it close to your mouth .On the other hands free corded I had the mic was on the wire that went to your ear , so it was closer to your mouth by 3 or 4 inches . . seems like a small thing , but it made a difference .UPDATELet me up date this . . . . . the above description was for the first one that I opened . Later that week , I opened the other two thinking to keep one in each car and one at the desk , the other two CAN NOT BE HEARD at all , no one can hear me when I use it . They are worthless as microphones the headphone part is fine so I essentially spent 10 .50 for one somewhat working microphone . . . . . CHOOSE ANOTHER . . . .	0

This dealership is 50 shades of shady . This review is 2 . 5 years in the making . I bought a Certified Preowned BMW from this dealership back in February 2015 . I am not going to go into all the details of the issues I had with the car through the years of ownership , but it ranged from run flat tires blowing up , engine problems , replacing all the air vents and some control knobs in the car . All work was done at my local BMW dealership free of charge under CPO warranty except tires . Highly recommend my dealership , they took a very good care of me . I ignored alll of these red flags through out the years . Wrote it off as part of BMW ownership . But today I got a unsettling dose of reality , when I took my car to CarMax for appraisal . In the first 5 minutes the appraiser found repainted body panels on my car , and declared oh yeah this car has been in an accident . I was devastated , I babied my car through my ownership , always served at the dealership , and was sure that it ca n't be true . Since Long Beach BMW gave me clear Carfax report with no accidents reported . CarMax printed out an Autocheck report on my car , which clearly showed a reported accident back in 2014 . How could Long Beach BMW miss this in their CPO Certification and not disclose this information to me ! ? ! It only took CarMax 5 minutes ! This dealership is shady . . . stay away .	0

Today is the second time I 've gone in for a lease deal , both times they wanted to match my current payments I 'm paying for the truck I 'm buying , almost 600 a month and a couple grand for a down payment .

Today they even tried to drop us down one level from the SLT to an SLE , 3 / 4 of the way through the 2 1 / 2 hour run around . I would n't recommend this dealership to my worst enemy , YUCK !

Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive , there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin , and to the touch not sticky at all . There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and stick was smooth . Overall , I was not impressed .	0
We Purchased 218 count Vanilla and 218 count Chocolate Premier Protein Shake cases last year from Costco . I had read good reviews and was looking forward to trying them .My husband and I both were hoping this would help with our low carb diet .When we tried the shakes we were at first impressed with the flavor , but then after just a few sips we encountered clumps and grittiness . Gross ! We live an hour away from our nearest Costco and only get there two or three times a year , so we did n't wo n't to have to return them . We struggled through a few more of these , but decided to get rid of the rest of the 218 count cases we had opened one of each flavor and return the two that we had n't opened to Costco .I had read recently that Premier Protein has reformulated these shakes , and if you had purchased these shakes when they were not at there best Premier Protein would send you a replacement / replacements .I emailed and asked about the reformulation , and explained about my inferior product purchase from their company . I received back an email within a few days that answered the question that 34Yes the shakes have been reformulated due to so many customer complaints , and bare a yellow banner stating it is reformulated . But , no mention of assistance on replacing the bad product that we had purchased from them in good faith .I emailed in return asking if we could in some way be compensated , even a coupon would be helpful ! After all we lost nearly 40 .00 on their unpalatable product ! No response back this time . So , I called the phone number given on their website . When I explained to the representative what had taken place she said I would have had to call when I purchased the product and given them the code numbers and letters from the product and they would have sent me a replacement . When I said I did n't think there would have been any point in a replacement at that time because the product was not to our liking disgusting she had no reply . When I asked about coupons to at least help with the cost of trying the new product she said I would have to go on Facebook . I told her I did n't have a Facebook account and she said that 's all the advice she could offer . I was very discouraged with , and disappointed in this company ! Thanks for nothing Premier Protein ! You got my 40 .00 and that 's all you care about !	0

Not accurate at all ! This is a terrible thermometer . My baby recently had her second fever and I could tell by feel when she was very hot around 102 degrees . I used this thermometer because it is fast and easy to use but it read 98 degrees . I took her rectal temperature with a regular thermometer and she was 103 ! Do not get this thermometer .	0

This sprayon product does only a soso job of cleaning pet stains . I 've used it on dog urine 34accidents34 on an offwhite carpet and on spots where a cat had vomited . Both were within a couple hours of the 34accident34 when the spot was still wet . I blotted up what I could and then sprayed the Woolite Pet Stain remover and waited about 5 minutes as per the instructions . Then I blotted with a clean cloth . That did n't do much . I then gently rubbed the stain . That removed some of it , but when it dried I could still see the stain .The spray has a perfumy chemical fragrance that is way too strong . A much lighter or nonscented product would have been preferable . This smell was just offensive .This product Church Dwight Co 51693 Oxi Clean Laundry Stain Remover which I 've used in the past did a much better job of pet stain removal , even though it 's meant to be a laundry stain remover . It works much faster , in a minute or less , is less expensive and has a light , pleasant smell . It also removes stains completely , even ones that are dried and set in . I should have stuck with one that worked .	0

Service writers will try to sell you items that are NOT on BMWs required maintenance list and are not normally even needed . My wife 's car went in for a simple oil change , covered under the service plan . They tried to sell us a massively overpriced wheel alignment without even knowing if we NEEDED one and fuel injector ' cleaning ' service . I have had 8 BMWs over the last 20 years , and never had the need to ' clean ' fuel injectors . If ' dirty ' injectors were an issue , BMW would have had cleaning as part of their service routine , and covered it under warranty . In summary , hold your wallet VERY tightly if you go to BMW of Mt View . Better yet , go somewhere you can trust . It is n't BMW of Mt View any more .	0

It has come to my attention that this product has been reformulated to eliminate the paraben preservatives , although the ingredient list on Amazon for this product is still listing parabens .The effectiveness of this product is pretty decent , the scent mild and unobtrusive and dissipates within a few minutes of application . The initial scent is an orange / citrus but is all but undetectable after about 3 or 4 minutes , so it will never interfere with a cologne , or to keep you completely unscented if that is your thing . The way I generally prefer my aftershave products to be .The witch hazel and other ingredients calms any mild irritation very quickly without stinging . If you like that alcohol burn , look elsewhere .	1
Thank You RideNow Powersports ! ! I generally do not write a review unless it was Great or Horrible ! ! I live in Southwest Utah and love riding the trails on my 06 Honda Foreman . I decided to sell my 06 to a close friend and was shopping for a new 2017 Foreman with power steering . I searched my local area and found what I wanted but the salesperson would not budge on the price , in fact I was given a lower rebate figure than Honda offered . I was fairly disappointed in my local dealership I searched the interweb and found RideOn Powersports and found that they had the exact same 2017 Honda Foreman es eps atv so I gave them a call . I was greeted by a friendly , courteous young lady that directed me to a sales person . The sales person I spoke with was very knowledgeable and helpful , within a short time I made a great deal and drove to RideNow on Rancho the next day to take delivery . with out a doubt I will take my new atv to them for the initial 100 mile service . I had a Great experience and highly recommend RideOn Powersports on RanchoThanks to Tony , Kaylin , Khanh and Kathy . I met a lot of great people , I apologize if I missed anyone . Respectfully , Reg Browne	1

Horrible . Purchased a battery from these guys a little over a year ago for my 2010 E63 AMG . The battery came with a 2 year warranty , and it has already gone dead . Upon trying to return / exchange the battery , i was denied . So now i am out another 300 for a battery . Could have gotten better service at an auto parts store . Not even to mention the fact that i have been sold incorrect parts for my car from these guys . Tried purchasing a oil drain plug washer oil filter , they gave me a washer that would n't even fit over the bolt . Pretty frustrating when i live nearly 2 hours away . Joke of a dealership .	0

Got this without realizing that it is made for women rather than men . My wife is pregnant right now and is very careful about what she eats and drinks so she would n't even consider this right now . So I decided , let 's try the 30 day challenge and review it from a male point of view . Why ca n't my skin look healthy and shiny ? I could use more energy . Ok let 's try it .I made my first glass according to the directions . I LOVE pomegranate juice so I was ecxcited about trying this . The powder mostly dissolved but it did n't dissolve as quickly and completely as some of the other powders I 've tried like Propel water . The color was very dark and it looked more like some kind of homemade vegetable juice than water .The smell was terrible from the start ! Hoping it was just a smell issue , I went in for the first sip . It was not just a smell issue . This stuff is horrible . Bitter , flowery tasting and just plain bad . While the poweder actually contains sugar , all I can taste is an equal or splenda like aftertaste . It is Brutal ! ! So , what do I do ? There is no way I can continue drinking this for another 29 days . It would be easier competing on Fear Factor and having to eat worms . The packaging does contain two recipes using various ingredients but I find this rather absurd that I would need to add so many other things to it to make it taste good considering the price .So I guess anyone wanting to know if men can benefit from this drink will need to look elsewhere . Sorry .Oh , and for the price they charge for this stuff . . . .well . . . .I wo n't say what I want to say but the horrible taste far outweighs any benefit this product might provide .I have read that the other flavor Rasberry something . . . is a lot better . So if you are truly in NEED of this product , I would start with the other flavor .Now please excuse me as I go brush my teeth again . . . .ugh ! ! !	0

They fit as described and the quality was more than expected for the price . I 'm a Yoga TeacherRYT and live in my shorts . These rock in and out of my studio .

I left a message with the dealership on Sunday requesting additional information about a vehicle I was very interested in buying without even needing to look at . I was so motivated this morning to make a five hour trip to buy the vehicle that I called them the minute they opened on Monday morning at 9 am . I spoke with who I believe was John and informed him that I was very interested in purchasing a certain vehicle and that I just needed to know the final cost of purchase after adding their fees because I was bringing cash in hand and I was very willing to pay what they were asking for the vehicle on the internet listing . He first told me that I would need to pay taxes on the vehicle even though I was out of state which I knew in fact was not true since this was not my first rodeo . He also informed me that there were several of other people interested in the vehicle and there was no way I could put the vehicle on hold even if I wired him the cash before my arrival . He told me that he would have to check with his sales manager and would call me back in five to ten minutes . I told him that would be fine but I wanted to know as soon as possible so I could get on the road to make it their dealership before anyone else could beat me to the sale . Shortly thereafter , Chuck called me in response to my internet message left on Sunday . I went through the same scenario with Frank and was also told he would have to check with the Used Car Sales Manager and he would give me a call back in ten minutes . This was at 9 am shortly after they opened their doors . I waited patiently until about 5 pm and never received a response from either one of these so called sales people . I decided I 'd try the internet message service again . Chuck called me back within five to ten minutes of my internet message . I explained who I was again and my first question was is the car still available ? He responded that he had a busy day today but yes , the car was still available . No apology or nothing was expressed . I think he was expecting me to apologize to him for having such a busy day . I reiterated the fact that I was very interested in the vehicle but could not possibly make it there before he closed . He in turn told me there was no way he could hold the vehicle for me until the following morning but did finally provide me with the final cost of purchase which did not include my states sales tax but more than 100 in other BS fees . Having in mind that the so called dealership was going to be open for about four more hours , I asked him if he could please call me when the dealership closed for the evening so I knew if I still had an opportunity to make the purchase first thing in the morning . Keeping in mind that the dealership was open until 9 pm , I would have to go straight to bed after receiving this phone call and get up less than six hours later to make it to their so called dealership when they opened . You can only imagine what happened at 9 pm . You guessed it , no return phone call . I just wonder if the reason neither one of them were to concerned with returning phone calls to a very motivated seller was due to the fact that I was paying cash versus getting caught up in all of their financing charges involved . Needless to say , I wasted most of my day dealing with these so called sales people . I wasted my time making car reservations that included a one way drop off fee , going to the bank to get cash out and making arrangements for someone to travel with me considering the fact that I was dealing with very poor performing , so called sales people . A couple of things for certain after this awful attempt at a car buying experience is that I will never deal with NonMotorWerks again and that I will be taking my money to a real car dealership that is interested in making a sale , no matter what payment method I am offering . Follow up on 7 / 26 / 2017Chuck finally got back to me while i was typing the review above . My phone was on the charger and I did not hear it ring because I had given up for th e evening . He texted and emailed as well and informed me the car was still there but there were a few tbings he wanted to inform me about the car . I immediately replied , what s wrong with the car ? He replied back , oh nothing serious , just some brake chatter on the front end that needed to be addressed . I told him no problem at 8 am my time and that I 'd be there in about six hours to pick up the car . After renting a vehicle and driving five hours there I was very disappointed for wasting my time . It wss obvious at first glance that the low mileage Vette had been wrecked . The front bumper did not match the hood and only matched one of the flip up headlights . The rear end also had been repainted . My son and I pointed all of this out to Chuck and all he did was scratch his head and shrug his shoulders and state I do n't know how that could be , it has a clean carfax report . After a closer view we discovered red paint on the windshield . I pointed it out to him and said you 've obviously repainted the vehicle very recently . No response . Another sales person came out there just to scratch his head in disbelief as well . I told him thank you very much for wasting my vacation day from work and making a trip for nothing .	0
If you want to start riding or looking into buying a new bike , Cycle City is the place to go ! I went to Cycle City last year with absolutely no credit history and they still got me approved for a BRAND NEW MOTORCYCLE for a very reasonable interest rate . The staff if very helpful , knowledgeable , and most important , friendly and inviting . You wo nt ever see salesmen trying to steal customers or a sale . They all work together to get you the bike you want whether it be asking each other for opinions or clarifying specs and options for a bike . And when you are ready to make a decison , their finance managers are just as friendly and helpful . They are willing to work with you no matter what your financial situatuon may be . And they will be on your side when negotiating with banks and or credit unions ! They will get you a good deal ! Rich and Keprah are the best . I would highly recommend seeing Jimbo . He is very friendly and wo n't push you to any specific bike , but rather help you get the best bike for you . He is soft spoken and very humble . He will treat you with nothing but respect . No matter what the question or concern is , he will be there for you ! Jimbo helped me choose my first motorcycle . He also brought me over to the parts department and helped me look into some accessories and some gear that would make my would make my first motorcycle buying experience easy and stress free . And today Oct . 13 , 2017 I traded in my first motorcycle for another brand new motorcycle all with the help of Jimbo . He talked me thought the whole process of trading in the bike and how they would use it 's value towards the other bike . He answered every question I had . The process went as smooth as ever , from coming in to look at the bike a few days earlier , to working out numbers , and then to final delivery . He is the guy to see at Cycle City ! From when you walk in to Cycle City , you will be treated as family . You will get greeted at the the door by the cashiers , get helped with anything from parts accessories , gear , and yes , with buying motorcycle .	1

It 's sad when you buy 2 brand new bikes from a place and then have to fight to get things fixed because they were not done right the first time . They only care about selling bikes and will do anything to get you to sign on the line . Service department kept my bike for 2 weeks after they fixed it . This was after they told me that they were basically throwing parts at my bike and not really fixing the problem . Took me calling the sales manager and telling him that they still had my bike and I wanted it back . I now have my bike back and it still makes the noise that I sent it in for . So save the trouble and go somewhere else . Run far far away .	0

Every once in a while , you buy something crappy enough that you know you 're just going to throw it in the trash as soon as you open it . This is one of those things . Such a piece .of .crap . I am here to be your moral compass and steer you far , far from this hunk of junk . 34But it 's only a dollar , 34 you say with innocent , naive hope . No , my friend . There are so many more things you could buy with a dollar that would not leave you empty inside and hating the world . A candy bar , for example . A soda . A zipper . A tiny , useless candle . A pack of clothes pins . A paper cup . All of these items would be better than this piece of crap . Oh , and it arrived broken . What more can I say ? If you disregard my seasoned advice and buy this thing anyway , or if you even add it to your cart , you 're on your own , sweetheart , and there 's no hope for you . Happy hunting .	0
This Invictus anniversary edition watch came in a largish box . I assumed the box was stuffed with padding but it turned out that this watch needed its canaryyellow , ribbed stitched leather box . It 's massive . Still , it must be said that the lovely tan suede interior displays the watch quite nicely .At first I was a bit disconcerted by the size of the watch . You can get some idea of why by looking at the sizing diagram with the pictures in amazon 's product images . The second thing that struck me was how heavy it is . It has a large crystal domeshaped face made of a material that goes by the trademark name of Flame fusion crystal . This is a kind of sapphire / crystal combination molecularly bonded in a very high temperature treatment and is almost indestructible . So if you want to take this watch cycling , it should be safe .The watch body is stainless steel treated with a gun metal finish . The face has chronograph stopwatch dials . What you might not be able to see in the photos is the cool semi transparent mother of pearl finish of the small dial faces and some of the trim . Because it is semi transparent , you can just make out some of the watch 's inner workings . I thought looking at the layers of day and date dials was very cool .This watch is the first in the world to use the SW 500 automatic watch engine movement . If you 're a watch enthusiast , you probably know what that means . If not , trust me , it 's pretty cool . If you turn the watch over , you have a crystal back inlaid in the stainless steel body that lets you see the mechanism working inside as well as the spinning counter balance that uses movement to spin the weight . This means that the watch literally winds up when you move your arm . It 's quite fascinating to play with .Despite being a big it is a beautifully made piece with large diamond inlaid 12 and 6 figures and small 4 clusters of diamonds for 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 and 11 o'clock . There is no 6 or 3 . The minutes are clearly marked though the thick dome crystal makes it difficult to accurately tell the minutes . You have to look closely to see exactly what time it is .The leather strap fits the molding of the body perfectly and looks very stylish . The strap is leather partly to counter the weight of the watch . It has a very light buckle that I first thought was plastic . But if you look at it really closely you can tell that it 's a lightly coated metal that makes a very sharp metallic sound .I would highly recommend getting some protective treatment for the leather before you sweat through the strap too much . It 's a gorgeous piece and the choice of leather is very comfortable , but , unless cared for , the leather will eventually dry out from the salt and moisture in your skin and crack .One last note is that this watch is a real attention grabber . At first I felt it might be a little ostentatious to wear all the time but it has really grown on my husband and I after the initial surprise of the size wore off .This watch is easy to set . There are three pronounced knobs on the right hand side . The top one starts and stops the stopwatch the bottom one resets it the center crown sets the calendar when you pull it half way , with month changing when you turn it anti clockwise and date when you turn it clockwise . Time is set when you pull it a second time and twist . All very smooth and precise , and just like you would expect from a watch of this quality .Bottom line this watch with its interesting , rugged styling can be a really special gift for the right person . I recommend it .	1

an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson	1
Over the last couple of months , I have been taking various Jarrow supplements that are suppose to help with memory and energy . Choline was the last one I added to the group . After doing so , I started reading a book a night ! I also started remembering a lot of dreams every night . Now , in the Spring , especially in March and April , I do tend to remember dreams more often , according to my old dream journal . Thus , I have to wait until after this month to see if my dream recall continues during months when it usually slows down . After noticing the increased dreaming awareness , I went online to see if choline was associated with strong dream recall . Sure enough , it is recommended as one way of increasing the chance of lucid dreaming . It is suggested one take both choline and galantamine . The thing is I rarely have lucid dreams , even though I have read various books on the topic , and have tried various methods to have lucid dreams . A good book on the topic isExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming . Maybe since I 'm taking choline now I should bring out some of my old lucid dream books , and read them again . I could read one a night ! Update 1 / 11 / 14 I still take one of these now and then , and they most definitely help with dream recall . They also seem to make the dreams more in focus . By that , I mean I notice things in dreams when I take one of these that I do n't usually noticelike someone 's hair . In the past , I 'd notice someone 's hair color in a dream , but now I 'll notice how the hair is cut and the texture of it !	1

Pros1 . Very sturdy boots2 . Comfortable and roomy fit .3 . Great lace up design with hooks above the ankle level .4 . Outer sole is great with nice traction in wet / snowy weather .5 . Good quality leather with gusseted tongue .Cons1 . Not water proof . Walking in 46 inches of snow for 20 minutes made my toes wet and freezing cold .2 . The seam between the outer sole and leather upper is not of good quality , it lets water in .SummaryGreat hiking shoes for mostly dry / light rainy weather .Must avoid this boots if you are looking for something waterproof .	0
People , stay away from the Nissan of Downtown LA what a lack of professionalism and customer service . My mom took her car for maintenance and they broke the windshield of her car . She went back to the dealer , Ernie Flores and David Pastor treated my mom as a liar and as someone who wanted to take advantage of the dealership . They argued that it was a stone that caused the crack when clearly it was a crack due to high pressure . Please people stay away from this scam . Come on this is the US , do n't let these kind of people steal your money . RESPECT	0

Poor dealership , staff , and experience full detailsDo not ever buy or lease a car from BMW of Houston North . My experience with them this week was horrible . I talked with the sales manager and we agreed on a price for a car and that I would be leasing it . Upon seeing the lease details , I noticed several mistakesThey overcharged me on tax by 200 . They were adamant it was correct , but they were proven wrong when they conceded and fixed the issue . Further , I noticed that they were going to make me pay an additional 1 , 600 upfront as a cash down payment on the lease for no reason , thereby charging me more than the agreed upon price of the car . They also charged me for negative equity on my current lease tradein , which they seem to think is fair to pass on to the customer . Then , upon talking to their finance department , I noticed that they were going to charge me additional interest money factor . BMW sets the rate at 3 . 62 0 . 00151 x 2400 and they were going to charge me almost 1 . 00 more , despite having excellent credit . They wanted to make more money off the financing in addition to the sales price , and this was unacceptable to me . Perhaps to someone who is unsophisticated in finance , all of this garbage would work . However , with over 10 years in the investment industry and as a manager of my own hedge fund , this is insulting to me . The people that I worked with who were involved are Barbara Angelopoulos sales manager , Ed Steinberg client advisor , Steven Cook sales director , Benjamin Chiu CFS manager and Nick Butuc general manager . Please avoid working with this group of people and the dealership in the future . At best , the members of BMW of Houston North are incompetent , uncommunicative , and passiveaggressive . At worst , they are nonpermissible content removed with no moral or ethical compass and are unaccountable for their actions . They poorly reflect the values and reputation of the BMW brand . Han	0
I was extremely upset with this case . I had a lifeproof case before this one and decided to switch it up simply because with speaker phone mode on it made an echo of my own voice and whoever i was speaking to . I decided this case would be better since many reviews said it worked fine on speaker phone and after 2 weeks of using it . . .well it does . On speaker phone this case does not muffle or echo any voices unlike the lifeproof case , but that is not the main reason why i bought these cases in the first place . I bought these cases because they are waterproof . I am constantly at the beach kayaking and paddle boarding . The lifeproof case is completely waterproof it has been drenched with water gone as far as 8 feet with water getting inside multiple times this case however by Seidio did n't last going in 2 inches of water . I did test it before putting my phone in the case and I had about 610 water spots on the inside of the case . I am extremely upset i spend so much money to purchase something that does n't work .	0

Well it arrived and it took a minute to figure out how to open the head , so after getting that down . I opened the head with a simple twist and threw a blade in it . After trying to tighten it down the head popped off with the blade . I chalked that up to user error and tried again . . .same thing . I could not get the head to stay on with any sort of secure feeling no matter what I tried . I managed at one point to get it to hold on but it still wobbled quite a bit and threatened to let go all together . Not what I would call safe , now with all the good reviews I would assume it was just the unit I purchased . However still it is defective and therefor warrants a bad review . I am going to return it and purchase a Merkur 34c , it is n't as pretty and does n't have the neat butterfly open . But I feel the butterfly feature is the reason for the defect in the one I tried . Too bad , it does have nice weight and a feel in the hand .	0
A pleasant experienceI never had a positive car experience before , this was the first . Anthony walked me through each step of the process in a trustworthy and respectful manner .

They said they would check it again but the soonest appointment was eight days in the future . Service department is to small and not well informed .	0

Such a disappointing visit last Sunday . We have 3 BMW 's in our household and our last 335xi was leased through BMW Bayside back in 2014 . I came in last Sunday specifically to lease a new 5 series because mine was coming due in 3 months and I kept receiving letters from Habberstad BMW in Huntington . Figured I 'd stop back in to see if I could get into a new car . Checked in at the information kiosk very nice receptionist and Denis came to help us . Introduced ourselves and then sat us down . 2 minutes later , he asked me for my name again to get my information . . . Really ? Told Denis everything I was looking for in a 5 series and to see if we could locate or order a car . In a span of 5 minutes , he built it on the BMW website , ran the numbers on the site itself , and told me my lease is going to be high 800 's per month . . . as if I did n't know how to surf BMWusa . com myself . I said oh okay , that seems a bit high for a 530 . Are there any incentive programs available ? He replies , no discounts on it . It 's a brand new car man , we ca n't get them . I said that 's a big price difference with like a comparable E class sedan . He replies , yeah , I do n't know why their programs are so good . . . . With that , we got up and drove down another 3 miles on Northern Blvd , went into Helms Bros MB , and put a deposit on a 2017 E class and brought it home today . Thank you for your recommendation . We came to buy a car and BMW Bayside took no time or effort to make us feel welcomed , or even appreciated as repeat customers . I do n't think he even took the time to find out that we were repeat customers . I wanted a 5 series really badly , but at the end of the day , at least the other dealership made us feel important for the money we were spending . When our X5 comes due in October , we 're not coming to you for sure . Perhaps a sales manager present on Sunday would have helped us get something done .	0

This was the easiest quickest and most pleasant car shopping experience I have ever had in 30 years of buying , leasing and trading in cars . When I called Jon at Spitzer Kia and explained the situation that I needed to lease a car as quickly as possible , not only was he instrumental in guiding me through the process , but also gave me fast and knowledgeable answers to all my questions so I could quickly make a confident decision to go ahead with this great offer . He even came and picked me up on the spot since I did n't have a car to get to the dealership . Imagine my surprise when he had me set up with a great deal and on my way home in my new Kia Forte within 2 hours . After my painfully long and difficult car buying experiences of the past elsewhere , I really appreciated how smoothly and professional this all was conducted at Spitzer Kia .	1

This is a great screen protector . It went on real easy and will go on many times if you do not get it right the first time around .

DesignRight from the start you will know this shaver is like no other . The weight and the feel of it upon first holding it tells you , this is quality . Once you plug in the wall charger and set this shaver inside the base to begin charging for the first time , right away you will notice the minutes digital screen . When this unit is charged , anytime there is movement of it , a LED screen smoothly fades in , displaying how many minutes the shaver currently has available for charge to shave . At full power , it shows 60 minutes . It takes about one minute of charging for every minute of shaving time .The button to turn on the shaver is also displayed via LED lights . It is a kind of touch screen turn on . There is no button sotospeak to turn it on . You press down in the area where the LED lights display and the shaver powers on .ShavingAs close to a blade shave as you can get without the blade . No uncomfortable pulling of the hair and no face irritation after using it . Cleaning is simple , buy running the heads under warm water after using it .ExperienceHolds a charge very well . Directions say to not keep the charging base plugged in after the shaver is fully charged . The shaver keeps it charge day after day without losing any battery life while unplugged other than that used up during use . This shaver is an investment , and with proper care will last many years .	1
After reading endless reviews and searching the web for information about the best kind of light to treat SAD , I was looking forward to trying this one . It came today , and I immediately set it up . I was surprised at how big it seems , but I could have lived with that .

Thanks to Amazon 's great customer service , I already have a credit to my account and a shipping label to send the thing back . Guess I 'll do some more looking .	0

My experience with the dealership has been excellent . Mr .

I never leave reviews but I feel people need to be warned about this one . We purchased a Certified Used vehicle from them on Saturday . During the purchasing process the general manager went on for 15 minutes about how well they inspect the used cars and how they only sell quality vehicles . We got the car home and the next day realized the tires were riding on the wear bar . I took it back in and asked their service guy if the tires were safe , he said they definitely need to be replaced . They were nice enough to give me a loaner car while I waited for my new tires that I was now being charged 700 more dollars to replace . I got home and realized I had some kind of fluid on my garage floor . I went back the next morning to look at the traverse to find it was leaking from the transfer case . They told me they would have to send it to chevy and I would pay half of the repairs . That 's when I kindly asked for my money back . They tried to get me into something else but we needed a 3rd row vehicle and the only ones they had left had really high mileage so we asked for a refund . After a lot of arguing they refunded me all but 500 . They said I needed to pay for a new detailing job , keep in mind we had the car for 1 day . I also had to pay mileage and docking fees . The GM then refused to talk to us and we were stuck dealing with a sales guy instead . Do not buy a used vehicle from these guys . We have since contacted gephardt and the BBB . We were sold a car under false pretenses then charged money to get a refund .	0

Hard to get into lot and no place to park . They blow off women their sales manager thinks women are stupid and can be pressured into buying at sticker prices . I went to Lee 's Summit Honda and bought a 2017 Kia Sorento with 1000 less miles for 1700 less with the 100 , 000 mile warranty that the sales manager MIGHT be able to give me at Kia . I was informed that car buying has changed in the last 6 years and I was behind the times . They were rude and did not think that women can make a decision on their own . Honda was so professional and treat you with respect and have a play area for kids . It was a wonderful experience at honda and the worse experience at Shawnee Mission than I have EVER been treated . I have bought 8 slightly used cars and have never been treated the way I was at Shawnee Mission Kia . Their excuse for everything was they were SO busy Saturday . I was paying cash with no trade in . I really felt insulted when I left . Mary Stutts	0

I wanted a car charger for my Asus TF300 tablet . Product description says the device works with tablet . Says nothing about incompatibilities .Guess what ? This product does not work with the Asus TF300 . They do have a website that lists compatible devices , but they do n't mention it in their marketing .Sorry , but things like this just tick me off . It would have required essentially no effort on the part of the seller to let people know this product would not work with all devices and refer folks to the manufacturer 's website .Be sure to check out that manufacturer 's website for compatibility before you order .Jerry	0
The bag is nice but I was a bit surprised at the size , could have been a bit bigger . The thing I do nt like about it is how the bag handle is positioned . It is difficult to get into the bag , ! for this reason alone it deserves a 1 star ! still trying to find the best way to get into it . I also saw in the review that people had problems with the handle being too long . well it is totally adjustable , however if you are below 5 3 then it may be a bit down to your hip . Lastly , the colour of the bag is a sort of stone wash look , what i mean it looks old because nobody commented about my new bag . I gave it a 3 star because its light and comfortable on your shoulders and I do nt have to be looking for my car keys , there is a key holder attached and a small purse which I throw my eyes glasses into so I do nt have to be looking for that either . I use this bag for work .UPDATE I recently discovered that there is a section under the flap where you can put credit cards , pens etc . Nice pockets but useless because of the way the bag is made .Also if you were to put stuff into that section the bag will become very bulky and distorted . Quite frankly I think that that section is a waste of time . I just use the front pockets for mobile phone and any little small item , including my car keys as sometimes it is difficult to find the key holder that is attached inside the bag because again of the stupid design to get into the bag . . . After some use of it , I must give it a 1 star , as i previously though it deserved .	0

Harley Davidson is not what it used to be ! I bought my second new harley about thirteen months ago ! It comes with a two year warranty ! At the one thousand mile service , the rear fender light kept going out ! They said it was a short ! Then my battery light was coming on ! I called them , and they told me to bring it in , it has a charging issue ! Took it in ! It was a loose negative at the battery ! Then yesterday I sat on my bike , looked on the ground , and there lay the emblem off the left side of the gas tank ! Took it in , and asked them to replace both of them ! They told me they can only replace the one that fell off ! I kinda wish I 'd bought a jap bike ! Probably built better ! Sure fed up w / harley ! Oh yeah , the rear fender light still goes off from time to time ! Cowboys Harley in san antonio ! I would not recommend to anyone ! Jus sayin , Quote from everyone I have asked . So I think y all mite want to step up your game .	0

My daughter attends college in a cold part of the USA . She always calls myself or her mom while walking in the freezing cold , so I got her this hands free bluetooth by Jabra and she loves it . The voice dial is fairly reliable , high winds can be a problem , the recharge is easy , and the sound quality is outstanding . The bonus over head ear adapater has not been used much . The only trouble she seemed to have was getting the blue tooth not to answer or dial when not in use , until she discovered it could be deactivated by simply flipping the mic fold back . Love it .	1

We hated it , we ordered blue and purple , just send it back today , because the plastic for the screen would not stay in . We had trouble getting the glue off of the screen cover . We ordered another type for our daughter , and it was a lot better than this brand . . .so we have ordered similar to hers . Would have given it a ZERO STARS .	0
The quantity and colors and the length are great . For the price it is an awesome deal . This is a good purchase .	1
I had a few blood stains set in for about a week by the time this arrived and I got to using it . I applied several drops to both sides of the stains and let it sit for 10 minutes and then washed the clothes . Did not reduce the stains even slightly .

I recently , and eagerly , ordered Protein 17 . It sounds exactly like what I want usda certified organic , grass fed and raw so minimally processed . Very important to me is that it is not instantized . I have blenders , I can blend the powder with endless tasty additions . But I really really really wanted pure whey protein , raw processed , grainfed and organic .And I am sure that is what PRoein 17 sells . But the guy took my money and 8 days passed with no protein . When I wrote to ask about the delay , he said he was backordered and his new supplier was testing and retesting its usda organic certification . Folks , I am an attorney who actually used to do some agricultural law and members of my family ran dairies . If a dairy is usda organic certified it is .The company should have told me immediately the item was unavailable and on backorder and given me the choice of letting them keep my money , interest free , while they hunted down more product . It is getting harder and harder to find raw organic grass fed natural whey and it costs more every day . I get that part . Butif I had known the stuff was backordered i .e . unevailable I would have ordered from somewhere else . This is not the only organic raw grass fed whey protein available online .he did refund my money when I asked about 10 days after I placed the order . I should have been given the option of a refund on day one when he knew he did n't have the stuff .A friend wrote to him a couple days ago and got another song and dance about how the stuff is gona ship any day now .I think this is a good guy who cares about very good organic whey protein but he has not worked out the kinks in his business . Supplies for this product are tightening up and that is now a part of the biz . it is simple business ethics to tell a customer what they paid for is on backorder and given the customer the choice to get a refund . I need protein powder and have a tight budget . I could n't afford to wait indefinitely for the magical arrival of protein 17 .I ended up ordering another raw , usda certified organic , natural , unflavored and nothingadded whey protein just like protein 17 brags about . We 'll see if it arrives right away .I'll give protein 17 another order . . but first I will ask if they have stock and are shipping immediately . I need protein powder . I need to know it will be here when i need it . This guy 's obsfucating made it hard for me to take care of my health needs . i counted ons his timely delivery , i ran out of protein and I never had to .I will try him again , but with more caution .	0

Written reviews on this product are polar . This happens to be the extra strength variety but you can also read reviews from the many users of the regular strength product . The bottle says to take one a day . Web site recommendations say start by taking 2 three times a day . I have arthritic pain in multiple locations and can get 34some34 relief with over the counter pain relievers .I chose the 2 three times a day route and stopped taking over the counter products . Some people report improvement after only one dosage day . I find that amazing . I 'm on day 15 and have found the product to provide ZERO pain relief . Incredibly disappointed after the hype on the website and the positive reviews . I goofed by buying a large supply . Do yourself a favor and IF you buy , get a small container .	0
i received a gift card . when i went to get tickets my only choice was cc or paypal no way to enter a gift card . ( later i discovered a little tiny checkbox . ditch that and make it a choice on the check out page . ) figured i had to sign up and did so . then when i went to enter the code ( was n't clear whether it was the 16 digit bar code and or the claim code . tried both and both did n't work . when i entered the claim code under check my balances , it did show a balance of 25 , which is correct . now , i ' ve been on hold for 17 minutes waiting for your customer support to answer . how do you guys stay in business ? you 're losing mine and everyone i will share this story with . update customer support just answered as i was about to submit . after 12 more minutes i was finally able to get my tickets . hint to the webteam call the fandango code the fandango claim code so that people do n't first try to enter the 16 bar code expecting to unlock with the claim code .	0

It 's thin and the front bezel sticks out to protect from laying flat . Though I 'd argue it sticks out a little too much . I also like the slight rubbery feel on the matte finish . The main problem is that the matte finish wears off almost instantly on the corners . It was already worn off when I got it revealing a black shiny base with peeling edges , and after one day in my pocket , all the corners were worn . Usually have luck with CaseMate , but this is not a good one .	0

These slippers are not only pretty , but also extremely comfortable ! The fake fur inside is very soft and silky , which makes it easy for me to slip the slippers on and off without much fuss as long as I 'm not wearing socks . The back is high enough , though , that I do n't find these slipping off all the time like my old scuffs . I love these slippers wear them all the time !	1
I ordered my size they seem to fit but once I wore them my foot slides down a little and presses on my toes . I tried tightening the laces but it did n't help . Get a 1 / 2 size larger . They just are n't as comfortable as I has hoped . I would send them back but I wore them so off to the goodwill they go .	0
Pomegranates are already well established for their healthy benefits A powerful antioxidant , heart health , nourishes skin , and is supposed to be a great inhibitor of women troubles PMS , menopause issues , ITUs , etc .Jarrow formulas is a very affordable and easily absorbed product as Pomproducts can be rather pricey , Jarrow gets my vote for reliable products that are easily digestible and affordable .	1
thanks for asking for my opinion . you need to make sure you give a correct estimate of how long it will take to send tickets to people as gifts . i sent some friends in arizona a 25 gift certificate as part of a christmas gift involving doris kearns ' biography of lincoln . the books got there on time . fandango 's tickets were two weeks late . that 's unacceptable . when your website said that gift certificate would be there by christmas , it needs to be there by christmas . otherwise , i will never use your service again .	0

Most definitely a 5 star rating . Dress is of quality materials , craftsmanship outstanding . I 've seen some negative feedback on Sakkas .com clothing , due to poor quality in materials and stitching . This is simply not the case with the dress I received . I could n't be more delighted . I have a few other dresses along the style of this from more high end speciality shops in places like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge some that cost twice or more what I paid for this dress , and side by side I would n't know that they did n't come from the same place . I have already ordered a 2nd dress from Sakkas .com this one I 'm awaiting delivery on is to wear to my daughters wedding . I would recommend this dress to anyone of any age . That 's how versatile they are .	1

They say that D3 assists in mood elevation and weight loss . This holds true for me , and even seems to assist me in my adrenal / thyroid recovery . In addition , D3 will help you women over 30 , especially absorb calcium more efficiently this lessens your chances of suffering at the hands of osteoporosis . Even if you believe that you get enough D3 from the sun , go ahead and try this brand out . This seems to be a remarkably bioavailable D3 , but keep in mind that this vitamin is NOT water soluble so be careful when dosing yourself , so as not to damage your liver . Do your research , and when you are ready , try 34Doctor 's Best , 34 as it is the best quality and most affordable .	1

I was worried that this protector would make the phone too large for my jean pockets . Not true . The added size makes holding the phone easier than without a protector . I am less likely to drop the phone and less likely to touch the edge of the touch screen by accident . It makes using the GX3 easier . One note it does not give screen protection . You have to buy separate screen protectors .	1

We ordered this because we were tired of having loose charging cables on the kitchen counter . . it just looks sloppy .Some reviewers complained about multiple iPhone 4 's not fitting .We do n't use any of the holders for any of our devices and it works great .I really like that the blue light turns on when a device is connected and turns off when it is disconnected .Keep in mind that the light goes on when the first device is connected and nothing changes for the second .If the light bothers you , there is a switch on the side to disable it .So far we have used it for iPhones 3 g , 3GS and 4 , old ipods and an ipod touch without any issues .I would strongly suggest this to anyone who needs a dual charger .	1

I took advantage of the deal they have going on right now and was very unempressed with such an expensive product stating that it can give u huge gains and super strength ! Its all BS and they know it too ! The people at Force Factor are not so bright themselfs and are very rude to speak to on the phone if u have any questions ! Better keep um to urself ! Anyways the Force Factor is a not a complete waste of money but it should not cost more then 20 to 25 a bottle of 120ct . maximum due to the fact I use a supplement that is working just as good if not better that Force Factor and its 10 .75 for the same amount of caps . Do nt get sucked into the Hype of this new expensive trend ! That s all it is 4 sure ! Thanks 4 listening ! Chris Berrier	0
Hands down worst place I ve ever worked in my life ! Management staff is horrible , You have a general manager who pretty much told me what I wanted to hear to get me out of a management position at a competitors store to sell cars . Turns out what I was told was not the case whatsoever ! You have a sales manger who is a compulsive two faced liar who has a problem with popping pills all day at work , dropping them out of his pocket every 30 minutes , refuses to get out of his chair to train staff , hold meetings or simply say hello , thank you for stopping in today Weird right ? ? Not to mention their horribly deceptive way of doing business , if you re in the market to buy a Volkswagen let me give you some knowledge first . . . They ll sit and tell you that you re not able to get s discount on a new vehicle because VDUB does nt do rebates well little does the general public know that there is up to 6 , 000 in dealer cash , that s right ! The dealer can make up to 6 , 000 on a new vehicle . So please people , Do nt help Taylor get richer by giving you false information . Last but not least the special finance manager who s not so special , Dan . If you have credit problems then this is nt the store to try and get a second chance at credit . This man will look at your credit report and elaborate on how much of a piece of shit or bum that you are , crazy right ? This man makes decisions on behalf of the bank without even submitting these people who may deserve a second shot to the bank ! Which not only does nt help the customer but helps the Taylors lose thousands of dollars ! This store is a complete and total failure and deserves better , The people of Findlay deserve better !	0

I 've had this case for six months weeks now .This is an edit to my original review , which gave the product five stars .The case was dropped once , and now there are parts shaking loose inside of it . At this point , the case no longer holds much charge , and therefore is no longer useful .For those who feel dropping it is the user 's fault and not the manufacturers , I will state that it is highly possible to make electronic devices that with circuits that do n't break . Even when you drop and iPhone , the worse that usually happens is the glass on the front breaks , not the actual LCD screen . I 've never personally heard a report of a dropped iPhone that did n't still function , even with a completely broken screen .So , if you are going to make cheap crap in China , this least you could do is spot a few extra pennies for some resin glue on the circuit board to keep the components in place after a fall from only three feet in the air .The design of this case is acceptable . The manufacturing quality is not in the least bit durable .SummaryThe iPhone 4S fits nice and snug inside this case . I 'm guessing the iPhone 4 would fit the same way . This case keeps an iPhone 4S going all day long with reasonable usage . Usually the phone stays at 100 until early evening , where the phones own power keeps me connected into the night .The good Real 1618 hour days of normal usage from my iPhone 4S . I mean making calls , web browsing , email . All that without thinking ooh , I should stop now before I kill the battery . I 'm not even afraid to use maps anymore . Perfect fit The phone slides into the case , with no wiggle room , and without being so tight it 's hard to get out . Easy installation The top of the case slides off easily , allowing you to easily slide the phone in or out with little effort . No prying needed . Size This is a battery case . It is thicker than some people want , but it maintains a very tight width . Basically , it adds some thickness to the phone , but keeps the width the same . Comfortable hold The case material is n't particularly rubbery or textured , but keeping a firm grip is no problem . Not slippery at all . Micro USB connector provides charging for both phone and battery , while allowing sync and USB iPod playback .The bad For those obsessed with aZoolandersized phone , this case adds bulk . Micro USB charging . The case charges with a Micro USB connector I ca n't imagine otherwise . But you have to easily take the phone out of the case to dock it . Your phone will weigh a couple ounces more , and be a little thicker . If adding 2 millimeters of extra size to your phone does n't fit in your pocket , you need to rethink your pants ! Effects on iPhone I have noticed no difference in reception . The sound from the speaker is a little fuller and less directional . Voice calls mic do n't seem to be affected .TIP If you are in a hurry to recharge , take out the phone , and charge the case and phone separately . The case wo n't fast charge like the iPhone , so this will help you in a pinch . Normally , do NOT take the phone out of the case to charge , and overnight charge will handle both batteries with no problems .	0

I used to get a lot of complaints about how hard it was to hear me on my car 's BT setup , as well as cutouts and static for no reason . Well , this little clip cured all that , and has the bonus of letting me stream music from my phone while it 's plugged in and I walk around the house doing laundry or dishes or whatever . Range seems to be 2530 feet , but cuts dramatically when you 're going through walls .The included headphones sound pretty good , and I generally use those . You 'll have to use some longer headphones to take this thing to the gym or walking the dog , because the clip really needs a pocket or something to latch onto , and does n't work so well with just a plain tshirt . A longer headphone cable lets you attach the headset to your sleeve or shirt tail .	1

Bought a 2014 Mercedes Benz on Labor Day weekend . While testing the car , we noticed that the passenger seat was making a loud clicking sound when adjusting position . The salesman assured me this could be fixed by Audi . Called the following week , placed on hold , asked if I knew they were AUDI and not Mercedes . Explained I bought the car from them . Assured they would call me back as there were only two techs on duty . Paid cash for this car . Still waiting to hear from Audi , but at least I held up my end .	0

We 've had this for about four years now and it 's always worked well .This is fast and easy , so much more so than the standard wrap they put on your arm at the doctor 's office . It gives you a readout in about a minute of your blood pressure and pulse .There are two settings for two people and readings are stored into memory so you can compare your old readings with your new one .There is a trick to getting a really accurate reading on any blood pressure guage and it is this . Sit very quietly , do n't chew gum or eat or move at all , breath normally .Have your arm propped up at heart level on a table . Relax this way for about five minutes in a quiet room . This gives your blood pressure time to normalize from any movement or excitement .There is the chance in doctor 's offices for some people of having an unusually for them high reading due to excitement or movement or pain from the blood pressure cuff .This method and little painless cuff gives a more accurate reading I feel than the doctor 's office for the reasons mentioned .This is comfortible to use . There is less pressure on the wrist than the pressureused on a traditional cuff . I have normal blood pressure readings with this but they are a bit higher at the doctor 's office . I think the readings I get with this are more accurate .This comes in a nice plastic storage box .I can highly recommend this .	1

The slippers are great and warm . I like the rubber sole which protects the slipper from damage and soil . I immediately wrote to Amazon to return them for a larger size . I followed the directions and got the return label which I placed on the box , following all the directions and never having worn the slippers more than a few minutes , and still tagged , After an inordinate amount of time , when the 30 return grace period was over , the same shoes were returned to me saying that I could not return them to the company because they do n't sell them . I do returns all the time . There are no other options for returning shoes . I went on line and made the initial request and then attached a label with tape that you provided , in your original box . Just like I did with hundreds of other purchases . This is the first time that the shoes were returned , AND too late to be able to exchange them . So now I am wearing a slipper that is not comfortable because of its size and I ca n't even wear thin socks with them , so they get soiled more from the oils in my skin . I am very disappointed with whomever is responsible for putting up the wrong graphics , OR from not offering a solution or an extended grace period upon which to return these unfit slippers . I will research my purchase and make certain that I do not buy from this company called 34Shoe Buy .com 34 Signed , stuck with the wrong slippers .	0

The last one was Hoodia and honestly I did n't get the expected results .Unfortunately Amazon is full of these fake reviewers find them out by clinking on their reviews you will realize that they consistently have only one or two reviews , they are the first to review a product and their reviews are exaggerated .Anyway , I got these Hunger Chews and I tried the recommended dose and even doubled it around 6 pm skipping a heavy dinner is fundamental for a successful diet , but I have not noticed my appetite being suppressed . I 'm on week two , this is a proven failure .Still looking for the magic pill but this is not . No side effects on my side as other customers complain , no appetite suppressant effect either .	0
my brother in law and i have tried for an hour to reserve two seats using a gift card for les miserables in lakewood , washington . i admit the computer is a little slow , but we are consistently given the your session has timed out message before we can finish . the last time was les than one minute allowed from the time the screen showed to the time out message in fact it was so fast i could not simply select time and date even knowing ahed of time where they would appear on the screen . there does not seem to be a way to get a hold of anyone to help . your site is extremely unfriendly .	0

I was unaware that changing my battery at another location would effect my cars computer . So I had to go to Leith BMW of Raleigh and had an 8 AM appointment for them to tell me at 1100 that I am going to need a new FRM Foot Well Module that 's going to cost me 1224 . 16 for an item they said was under warranty up to 125 , 000 miles . I called BMW to ask if they could do be a courtesy of extending the warranty to me since I am at 128656 miles and the lady told me NO we ca n't do anything for you . I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BMW EVER AGAIN . If I knew about the warranty it would 've been changed long time ago . If BMW new they had issues with this item then they should at least given us the courtesy of informing us . HIGHWAY ROBBERY .	0

I purchased this as an upgrade to my Jawbone ICON . Big mistake . The first one I got was defective out of the box . The second one has static all the time , even when I am a few feet from the phone . This is AFTER the firmware update . My ICON sounds better . This is their top of the line ? For the high cost , I expected more . I finally returned it and went back to my ICON .Don't waste your money !	0

Patrick Green is definitely the associate to see ! He was able to find the unicorn for us we came in with a strict budget , were not looking to lease , and wanted something reliable . Patrick was able to work with us to find an amazing deal on a fantastic newer used vehicle . From the start , Patrick actually listened to our concernssomething that we wish we could say for other dealerships on Tamiami Trail . We can not thank Patrick enough for his incredible service . Additionally , Tino Sales and Anthony Finance Manager were a complete pleasure to work with as we sealed the deal . Look no furtherget to Sutherlin Nissan today and work with this amazing team !	1

The case looks cool , but the clear plastic scratches way too easily . I first scratched when I was trying to remove the plastic film protectors . The one on the inside of the case was hard to removed so I had to pick at it with my fingernail . When I put it on my phone I noticed what I thought was a smudge where I had been picking at plastic film . So I removed the case and tried to remove the smudge by wiping it with a cotton cloth . Big mistake . It turns out that I had scratched the inside of the case when I picked at the plastic film and then made even more scratches when I wiped it with the plastic cloth . Since I have a black phone , the scratches were really visible .Very disappointed that this case scratches so easily .	0
Crappy service . They had me wait here all day to return my car and say oh we forgot to do your alignment ! Also have yet to refund me in the time frame that was stated then the constant run around . I 'll never deal with you unprofessional group of ingrates again	0
At one full charge , this battery is able to charge my iPhone4S 3 times and iPad2 once fully from 10 .I've also tried throwing this thing on a giant rock while hiking and it only cause minor cosmetic damage .Have yet to test its water resistance ability but from the looks of it , the exterior construction and how the opening to all the ports are protected with a thick rubber gasket that fits into each port . Gives me a peace of mind if it is ever exposed to water .Overall , very satisfied with my purchase .	1
I tried to figure out how to get these cold . I tried squeezing them not cold . I tried chilling under cold water not cold . I tried refrigerating not cold . I even tried freezing them , but they just thawed out as quickly as an ice cube . Amazon , as usual , took them back with no questions . Love you Amazon !	0

I wanted a total and completely free feeling 100 cotton pair of capris for traveling about and sitting in a car or on a train or plane . However , these have the waist elastic go down too far to make us look thinner ? and fashionable ? and sitting in them is very uncomfortable with the feeling of being bound in like a girdle I am going to return them also because some of fraying where the girdle elastic waist is sewn on . However , beware of the lure of free returnsthe label is for shipping back with no postage cost but the cost of the return postage and handling for me 7 .50 will be deducted from my refund .	0

I was excited to get these Crocs , because I have a pair of leopard print thong sandals very similar . Imagine my dismay when I pulled them out of the box and the left shoe was completely broken through at the thong . There is no way a person can wear a broken thonged flip flop shoe . I had to print out a return sheet , and rewrap the shoes and put them back in the box . I put them on my front porch and UPS got them . Now I am waiting for a refund to my credit card . I surely wished the person who sent them to me knowing they were used and said to be in perfect conditon had LOOKED AT THEM .	0
2 times now i have used fandago to beat the lines and both times i have been unable to print my tickets using the concession kiosks . i have had to wait in line . so basically i have had to pay more than i needed to for a convenience fee and processing fee . i talked to the manager at the movie theater and he said it never works . i wo nt be using fandango again until i know this is fixed .	0

The package I received contained a pair of fishnets . I wanted something fun and sexy , yes . But something which could be put on under a skirt or dress and be conservative enough for everyday life attending class at my University , going to work , tutoring middle school children . What I received was fair quality and might be good for a Halloween costume or something , but frankly , I would never wear fishnets . I ordered sheer thigh highs .	0

This individual is emotionally unstable and quite incompetent . He called me repeatedly of which I have the records to insult me over the phone and demand I come to the dealership to face him . I leased a Lexus LC500 and I 'm very busy running multiple businesses so suffice it to say I can not face him . First time Lexus owner , last time client of Lexus North Miami . So bad in fact , I had to open a case with Lexus of North America to resolve the issue with Sean Hazeesh or something I think is his real name . Even writing this review is a waste of my time but what can you do ?	0
I bought a pair and they 're not by any means fancy . But I 've been using them for a couple of months for lifting and pull ups and my wrist no longer hurt at all . Excellent for the price .	1
The battery seems pretty powerful . I do n't know if it 's really up to 1600 mAh , but it seems to be of good quality and fits perfectly in my DHD . Also fast shipping . For the price a good deal .	1
This is a great phone , it does everything I need . Plus it gives off less radiation than most phones . It had a good GPU and a great CPU some phones in this price range only have a CPU . The Samsung Processor is one of the fastest in terms of processing multi scrips , some test shows it to be faster than a dual core chip set . Wifi is set to only 25 and its still V fast if on the N setting 15Mb down and up . I have not rooted it yet , but I am sure once I do it will be faster . I would not take a diffrent higher end phone if you gave it to me .	1

Hendrick Lexus is all about service and experienceRecently bought a GX460 for my wife and our sales associate was Terrance Clark . If you 're on your way in , look for himhe was great , real , helpful and not overly salesly . Terrance showed us both vehicles we were interested in , explained the differences , features , etc . We came to an agreement on value and left with a vehicle that my wife loves . My wife went back the next day for an indepth orientation to her new features and he spent a few hours with herafter the sale . Everyone raves about Hendrick Lexus service and they did not disappoint .	1
Unlike regular shave gels that turn into foam when you apply them , this remains clear and close to the skin . It works great with an electric razor where you do n't want a bunch of foam clogging up the works . I assume it would be likewise great for a regular razor but I ca n't comment on that . I only wash off the blades at the end of the shave with this , where with the kind of gel that foams I had to wash the blades every few seconds .So if you want to shave in the shower with an electric razor , this is perfect . The menthol version is great if you like the feel of menthol , but otherwise they work the same .	1
Juan was exceptionally polite , helpful and had our car tires aired up quickly especially since I was with my toddler . Great service .	1
my theaters has n't worked for quite some time . you can click it pretty much anywhere and it does n't bring you to your theaters , it just brings you to the screen to enter a zip code to find a theater . might want to fix that eventually . . . how you have n't by now , i honestly do n't understand . it 's a rather important part of your website and it 's also relatively easy to fix .	0
we go to the movies perhaps once every 2 months . that said , if you want to improve the experience , perhaps the cost of concessions could be lowered . it 's crazy that a popcorn and soda cost more than the tickets to attend the show .	0
Great experience buying my 2017 Kia Soul . . . no pressure sales team and an unbelievably low price . The best car buying experience I have enjoyed in years !

Its a reliable and affordable Mini Cooper equivalent .	1
OK , so i was a skeptic decided to give it a try . From the first time i put in on i saw a big difference . Now let me tell you i took the sdvice to up a size . I started to order a 2x but decided to go for the 3x . When the 3x arrived i thought 34how the heck am i going to get in this34 . I had to have my husband help me get up in it , but once he snapped me in it felt great . It was easy to wear and walk in . I even work to work . Another review said to wear it before bed and sleep in it if it 's very uncomfortable to wear during the day . But for me it was fine . I loooooove This shaper ! !	1
I love taking these ! I 've tried chewables , powders , and big tablets . Yuk . I hate them all .

My Dermatologist recommended this for me I wonder if she realizes how expensive it is for a recurring fungal infection under my belly to try and absorb some of the excess moisture which forms and creates the perfect growing environment heat , dark and moist .

This is the fourth one I have bought and they all stop working within six months . This one only lasted one use . It would turn on and sound like it was working , but the blade was moving and therefore not cutting anything . I also ordered the Panasonic pivoting shaver to compare this time and it works really well . I ca n't believe I have wasted my money on this poor made product four times before I decided to try another brand .	0
This bra is not for me . First off I do seem to be in between 34H and 34I in some brands . I can not go bigger around at all as my actual measurement is 32 . Also this bra smashes the breast tissue into a very conical shape which my breasts just will not smash enough for that . Had high hopes for this but just not right for me .	0
I have other plantronics products and have been very pleased with them . This item has been a huge disappointment to me . The look and feel of the headset are great , looks are deceiving . The connection is often broken , leaving a cracking sound in my ear making it difficult to hear my customers . The range of the headset is poor to say the least . Do not plan to walk very far . If you do so the cracking sound worsens until the unit disconnects , and to far is more than 10 ft . I have returned this product . Hopefully the engineers will fix the frequency , because they have a good looking headset , but that 's it .	0

11 / 1 / 16 STAY AWAY AT ALL COST ! I have had our truck for 2 months now and I still do not have financing on it ! I spoke with the GM and all he told me was that he had taken the dealership over about a month ago , and they were going through some changes . He also reassured me that things would be taken care of . Well they were n't ! It came time to make our first payment , and I called the bank we were financed through only to be told that they had ZERO record of us or the truck . So I call Mini , and they tell me that we have to come to the dealership yet again and resign docs . NOBODY even bothered to call us and tell us that we needed to come down and sign docs . I would have NEVER known had I not called the bank to find out that our loan is still not funded . Not to mention they gave us a green slip and I have already registered the truck , but it 's not funded . Which I am pretty sure it is illegal to give a green slip without a vehicle being funded . This place is a joke . Save yourself the hassle and find another dealership . 10 / 7 / 16 If I could give Mini of Las Vegas half a star , I would . This dealership is absolutely HORRIBLE ! I wound never recommend them to anyone . Their finance department is a complete joke . And forget asking to speak to a finance manager , because they will all tell you they are the finance manager . Best part of the team management they have going on , not a single one of them is competent at their job . Not once , not twice , but THREE times was our deal done incorrectly . It took a whole month to get a deal financed , and once it was financed they never even notified us ! I had to call and ask for my green slip because the dealer tag was going to expire . For people who have worked in auto finance for 15 years they sure do n't know what they 're doing or how to communicate . I literally had to call the dealership to get anything accomplished . And forget the I 'll call you back , because they wo n't . I 'm pretty sure Chimps could do a better job than these guys . Stay away at all costs . I mean unless you like babysitting , having a constant headache and high blood pressure . Cause that 's about all they 're selling . This is totally the truth about this car lot this not my story but the shoe fit	0

We had a wonderful experience working with Dylan Fernades while buying our new 530ix . The car is a lot of fun to drive and offers lots of cool features , many of which we still need to learn !

After inquiring through their website , Allie in internet sales contacted me promptly and arranged my test drive . The following day I met Sam on the floor and we test drove my vehicle .

Everyone from initial contact through the whole process was wonderful to deal with . I will be back for my next vehicle when the time comes !	1

I purchased this phone with no intentions of using it on ATT . For how cheap it is , I can keep up with what Windows mobile is adding to its feature set I 'm primarily and Android user . I 'm impressed with the evolution of Windows mobile . Even though the adoption rate is slow , it 's nice to see Microsoft be the underdog and actually put real design behind Windows mobile .Don't let the specs fool you They really squeeze all the performance out of the dualcore Snapdragon CPU . It 's smoother than my Nexus 4 , which operates at 50 higher frequency , and has 2 more cores .	1

I bought a car from Santa Monica Audi previously . I attempted to buy a new one but they refuse to use email . I got tired of having them call me incessantly during my work day and interrupting so I kindly asked them to email me the relevant information for a new purchase , but they apparently ca n't do that . I 'm not sure how you ca n't do that in today 's day and age , but maybe it is just me . The lifetime value of a customer is apparently not that important to them so I 'll take my business elsewhere .	0

UPDATED REVIEWHad an issue with the service department the general manager called me the next day and took care of all my concerns very good customer service will continue to do businessNever in my life have I been so disrespected to the point where I just do n't know what to say I came in to get my car serviced at the dealership and at the time of pickup I look at the front of the car and I noticed my front passenger side bumper had been torn off the service advisor RJ Yensco had no sympathy for me he was extremely rude he made me feel like I was a piece of garbage compared to everybody else the manager was very friendly when i first met him and try to helped to help me as much as he could but it turns out he ended up zip tying the bumper back on after waiting several hours at the dealership for them to fix the bumper i asked to speak to the manager again to see if i possible could get a free car detail for all the headache i had gone through at the dealership RJ told me the manager is busy with other customers and he has no time for me he also told me to stop complaining and he will call me when he does have time I will never ever go to Ferman BMW ever again and I will never recommend any of my friends or anyone to do service there especially with RJ Yensco . This was my first time doing service at ferman bmw and Unfortunately because of RJ i feel like Ferman BMW does not care about their customers or their service and their service advisors are extremely disrespectful and hateful .	1

I love lip products and was disappointed when I could NO LONGER find at local drug and department stores . As usual Amazon comes through and I stocked up . This product stays on for a good while and the flavor is pleasant .The only downer is that you have to apply with a finger , but , that actually allows perfect coverage . Love , love , love it .	1
My lips have been so chapped this winter . All my friends loved EOS and they looked so cute I decided too give them a try . I had to keep reapplying many times during the day . Then a strange thing happened my lips started peeling all around the outside of my mouth . No amount of EOS would help . I started thinking maybe EOS was the problem . I got a tube of Blistex to see what would happen . In less than 24 hours my lips were back to normal . No cracking our peeling . I guess I 'm sticking with the cheap stuff !	0

Still waiting for them to get it rightThe part I was told had been ordered was not the part that was actually ordered . I was advised the part had arrived and scheduled the repair for the following week . I was called that the car was repaired and ready . When my wife got in the vehicle , the part repair had not been performed as explained , the part was not ordered as I was told , the replacement did not occur as I was promised . Worst of all , the technician nor anyone else in the repair pipeline had even tested their alternate repair to identify if it had worked . So we were presented a car in the identical nonfunctional state we had delivered it to them . A waste of time and a waste of patience .	0

They are the worst dealerships ever . They do n't give you the facts or history about car when you buy . They also do n't try to accommodate the buyers after they 've purchased car . No one ever works they 're long . There 's always new employees / dealers when ever I get an oil change .	0

It may / or may not have needed this , she was pitched a ton of other items , but told this was the minimum amount to make the car safe When I asked GUS why the price was so high , he stated call BMW if you do not like it , see what they charge . I stated , this is not a BMW , to which his reply was I sell what I am told to sell If you are not knowledgeable about vehicle service , and parts , I would avoid this place . They will defiantly take advantage . Waiting on a call from the Service Manager Randy . We will see if he is any better . Called four other local dealers , all quoted between 225 . 00 and 464 . 00 being the highest for the exact same service . . . . . . . . . . .	0

If you truly have a clogged ear like my son gets which would result in him going to the doctor for removal every other week , this product is a joke . It hardly has any pressure at all . You can use the cheap syringe with ear wax loosener that can be purchased at Wal Mart and get super results . This went into the trash at our house . Let me also note that I understand that my son might seem like an extreme case to you , but I really do n't think that this syringe could remove much of anything . There just is n't any pressure there .	0

Purchased a car 9 / 2 / 2017 , I have n't even made the first payment and the car is in the shop already needing over 1900 of repairs . No problem since Autonation has a 90 day bumper to bumper warranty right ? ! Well the warranty only works if the finance manager after signing the contract sent the paperwork in . Needless to say , the car is still in the shop , no work is being done because the warranty company had no record of the car being sold . I have no loaner car to use . I ca n't get anyone to call me back or rectify the situation . The only person willing to help me is my sales person who I 'm thankful for the one star is for his efforts Paul has been very nice throughout this whole process , although he too is hard to reach . I was referred to this dealership by a longtime customer . A family friend even works in the service department . But the decision for this purchase is quickly turning out to be a decision I regret .	0

Dishonest service and does nt stand by their word of warranty code and customer services satisfactory moto . Just want my seats repaired and they fought me tooth and nails to not repair them . Even lied to the warranty Rep . Saying I put something on my seats . Wo n't be going to Gerry Lane anymore , I would rather drive to Hammond and spend my money there for customer service . FYI I worked in the service dept before and they will deny warrant work much as possible because they do n't make their money in warranty claims .	0
This is quite possibly the worst purchase I 've made on Amazon . While I certainly was n't expecting perfection for this price , this item was absolutely useless . I ordered multiple covers to protect my 4 iPhones and I could n't get ONE of them to go on without an absolutely ridiculous amount of dust / bubbles beneath the cover . I used the included dust cloth to remove the dusty but if you look closely , it actually leaves more dust on the phone . I 'm an extremely meticulous person who took extreme care in applying the cover dust free environment , cleaned the phone thoroughly prior to application , etc , and I could n't even get one of the 4 to go on .The kicker is that about a year ago I ordered this same item and it worked fine . My shipment from Abe123 was either a different item or the quality has taken a severe turn for the worse .	0

We 've been using Magic Jetz Scrubz for years , and we love them zero complaints . They are tough , and tackle any abuse we throw at them . They 're durable , and we typically use them for so long that we end up throwing them out on principle rather than because they 're falling apart or getting smelly .Any and every other sponge we 've ever used has eventually began to fall apart and / or stink and / or lose the ' scrubby ' part through abrasion / erosion . Not these , they just keep working , and do a great job of cleaning .It may seem silly to post a review of a kitchen sponge , but when a product is this good it 's worth taking the time to let other shoppers know .	1

paul yanover , you asked what would make the movie going experience better in 2013 . here are a few suggestions . first , each facility should be thought of as an entertainment center , and provide a pleasant experience . step one is to have the ticket selling station far enough inside the facility that people do not need to stand ourside while waiting to purchase a ticket . step two is to have the facility feel clean . dirty , butter soaked carpet is just not appealing nor attractive . no customer would ever pick something up off the floor and dropping a coat or something gives one a feeling of horror . decorations should make the facility look exciting and inviting . all i ever see is just standup or poster advertisements for future movies . decorate the place , do n't just advertise . sell more of a variety of stuff ( not just food ) and make the prices more reasonable ( lower ) for food . we buy the popcorn , but feel insulted by the prices . the prices are simply disgustingly annoying .	0

The device seemed to be working but my wifes doctor noted that her BP readings were inconsistent with his . He had her bring the unit in to compare with the office units , did both automatic and manual and then did a reading with this unit . The Diastolic was 20 points higher . I contacted Panasonic for a No Hassle replacement since it was under warranty . They gave me an address in McAllen Texas to forward it to . Spent another 11 dollars on shipping fees on 2 / 23 / 12 . So far no response . Not a peep . I am frustrated .3 March 2012 Update Instead of returning a new unit , they sent a letter requiring proof of purchase . I returned my unit in the original box with all accessories . Does Panasonic think I stole it ? I asked for a replacement , not a refund . Does Panasonic think I just love to have blood pressure cuffs ? Their No Hassle Warranty is n't worth spit . I have lowered this review to one star , and if they had one without stars I 'd have used it . Very , very disappointed with Panasonic . Logic should tell them that I bought the unit . They know it was shipped to Amazon .com for sale . I told them when it was purchased . The total cost is only 40 ! I will not bankrupt Panasonic by asking for a new unit that performed as advertised . Pretty poor PR Panasonic ! ! ! ! ! I 'll take the refurbished unit , and never buy another Panasonic product . How much did that Hassle cost them ? ? ? Who knows .	0

The service here is horrendous . They had my vehicle for about 6 weeks . I had tried calling and calling and no one ever returned my call . I called to ask to speak with a manager . When I did , he did n't know anything about my vehicle . When he called me back he informed me that the initial repairs were completed , but that my car had been hit by something / one and had to be repaired . I asked what hit my car and he said they did n't know because they had no cameras in the parking lot ! ! ! How ridiculous is that ? In a place where so much could happen , cameras . They said my car would take several more weeks to repair . After a few weeks , I called and called and the service manager never called me back . Finally I did get a call and when I called him back , he never returned my call . I finally had to call the dealership and ask for the general manager . I also sent an email to the original manager with whom I had spoken . I told him not to have the service manager contact me that I wanted to speak only with leadership . Guess who called . I will never go back here again . The service is horrendous and they need some serious leadership training across the board . Not to mention , your vehicles are not protected as there is no surveillance .	0

I received a free sample of this to review on my blog . I have a toddler and she is not yet potty trained She wears diapers to bed and sometimes we have leakage issues if she sleeps too long or drinks a lot before bed . I needed something to protect my mattresses , but not necessarily a whole bed cover . . this is the perfect size . It can fit the toddler bed and my bed in case of issues .I placed it under the sheets , and it has been fantastic . Stayed in place , never lumpy and when the leak happened , we could whip this off easily and get it washed in time for bedtime the next night .Thanks !	1
I purchased a new Frontier and when I picked it up it was dirty and had visible scratches on the hood . It also has a missing paint problem below the drivers door . They scheduled a time to have the issues addressed , I left it with them for 3 days . Upon return they had buffed the scratches but the service manager told me they chose not to fix the paint problem at All Angles because it was to expensive . They planned to just do a touch up job . They were also going to help me get an adapter for the trailer plug but that was not addressed either . I did not get a call to reschedule for the touch up work so I called Rita . She informed that they had scheduled me for Tuesday , to my surprise . I requested that she talked to manager and that I wanted it fixed per the All Angles assessment . She called me this afternoon , late on a Friday , to tell me that they were not going to do anything else for me . I will let you decide if you would purchase anything from this dealer .	0

This is a good looking cube shaped speaker which pairs easily to any bluetooth device . It took only an hour to fully charge it with the included microUSB cable .This has five buttons on the top on / off , phone , bluetooth pairing , up volume and down volume . There is a red light near where the two cords plug in which lights when charging and turns green when charged . When pairing with bluetooth this flashes blue .I want to talk about the sound of this . I 've tested a variety of small bluetooth speakers . None of them sounded terrific . None of them had much volume . This one does have volume and it does sound great . There are two speakers in this , one on each side of the cube , for a bit of stereo sound separation . While this does n't compare to my Sony or Bose Speakers costing hundreds of dollars , for the price and small size , the sound quality is several cuts above what most of these little bluetooth speakers put out . There is plenty of volume , enough to hear it well at a moderate distance . There is no harshness . There is a richness of sound . This is something you can really enjoy your music listening on .I received this in gold and it 's attractive . I love how it feels . It ' 's got that rubbery hand feel . Overall I 'm impressed with this . I 'm taking this with me on my next trip and will have some enjoyable listening in my hotel rooms , without the worry of taking my expensive portable speakers with me . And I can charge this up and take it to the beach with me . Other small speakers in this price range that I 've tried so far have n't been worth bothering with . This one most definitely is a keeper . It sounds and works great , and it looks good too .Sample provided for review	1
After reading some of the negative reviews of this dealership I almost made the mistake of not coming here . This has been the ABSOLUTE FINEST auto buying experience I 've ever had bar none . From the personable welcome by the gal at the desk to the test drive congeniality to the best part of all , my salesman , Paul . An absolute gentleman with no nonsense .

If you do n't know cars are get scared easily they can easily try to scare you into services that you do not need . They only use codes to diagnosis issues . they do not road test . They lie . They only care about their survey and will send you emails to let you know to rank them 10 out of 10 . If you do n't you will get a nasty intimidating call from Steve Bylis himself . he never apologizes and half of the time he is the problem .	0

Service department , really disappointedWe drop off our vehicle last week for service and the staff was n't to helpful , and today we pick up the vehicle , and they did n't work on the items we show them to work on it . Also they replace one of the wheels and install a older wheel with scratches on . And many other issues to mentionWe are really dissatisfied with the service at allThe stain on the seat was there before we purchase the vehicle and they did n't work on it ether , also now we just found scratches on one of the screensThank you	0
A great little bracelet which weighs just 48 g so very light weight on your wrist but be aware if you wrist is like mine at over 8 inches round the bracelet is going to be a very tight fit on your wrist and it is no adjustable which is a shame but saying that it is not uncomfortable on the wrist it is wearable .The size of the Bracelet is as follows External length Just under 3 inches , Internal length 2 and a quarter inches , Width 1 .5 inches , Depth about 13 mm .When you first charge the internal battery which takes around 2 hours 10 minutes the battery indicator on the screen lights up on the top right of the screen and goes up in stages while charging and stops when full charged but to display the icon to check on the charging just press the down key on the right hand side of the bracelet .The USB charging cable the bracelet is supplied with is 39 inches in length and has a special connection on the opposite end of the cable to connect to the bracelet .You can switch the bracelet On / Off with the B / Down key and when you use it by holding the key in you will hear a beep .Bluetooth pairing is easy and best done when turning the bracelet on and holding the key in till you see on the screen pairing then you can pair it with your phone and get a beep when connected and disconnected with a long vibration from the bracelet .The sound from the bracelet is of good quality in a phone call or when playing music from your phone and you can adjust the volume by using the Up / DownA / B keys by tapping them in .If you dropped the bracelet do n't worry as it is made of a very sturdy plastic and would not break also the inner side of the bracelet has some padding for your wrist for extra comfort .	1

I have had what is called in Dr . Lingo , Plantar Fascitis .What it really is , is a Bone Spur in normal Lingo .All these types of contraptions that are sold , really do not work . .I know .Years ago when I had a bone spur , I was walking on my toes , cause the pain was so bad . .A very wise older women told me there is a vitamin to take that would dissolve the bone spur . .Yes I bought it and it worked . .But thenthe company changed the formula , and the Bone spur was back after being gone for about 2yrs . .I also took the vitamin everyday .So now I 'm searching the web . After about 3 months , I find on Amazon no joke . a vitamin called , Acid A Cal . . .It is cheap , about 10 .00 . .I took it for about a couple of months . After taking acid A Cal , my bones spur has been gone for about 5 yrs now . .I only took the acid a cal for a couple of months , and never took it again .I also went for Physical Therapy , which was another joke .She put my foot in Ice Water , she would massage my foot , and sold me this type of Foot thing to sleep in , as it is suppose to take thepressure off of your heel Heel Spur . . .Nothing she did worked . . .Also the Podiatrist Dr , gave me a shot of a steroid , but would not tell me till after he did it . .When his nurse came in to hold my leg down , I knew I was in Trouble ! That damn shot was so painful , till he took the needle out , and the Heel Spur pain only went away for maybe 6 months ! . .Everyone should know , that Steroids NEVER leave your body . They float around and cause other problems .I might add that I had a bone spur in my throat due to a car accident when I was 20 yrs old . .After taking Acid A Cal , it also took my spur in my throat away . .Go figure ! ! ! Do not expect taking acid a cal , it will work over night , but it does work , and I have told other people about it , and havegiven a couple of bottles away .Everyone has said , Oh my Heel Spur Plantar Fascitis is gone . .I have nothing to do with this Vitamins , and do not know why it works , but it does . . .Just want to say it works if you take it everyday , and I did not take as much as it says on the bottle to take . .Also did not have to take more then one bottle . .This might not be the forum for leaving this review , so I 'm taking this review to the Acid a cal page . . .Good luck . . .	0
hello , i just went throuh your special offers hoping to earn a free movie ticket and found out that the only one i have n't tried which looked appealing is actually a scam . i was about to submit an idea to inventing . com . and decided to get some background on the company first . according to reviewopedia , inventing . com is connected to davison inventions , also described on reviewopedia . i read many recent posts by people who were scammed out of hundred , thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by this site company . apparently it 's been going on for a long time , as davison was recently ordered to pay 26 million in restitution to former clients after they were sued by the federal trade commission and lost . i doubt this is the kind of company you want to be associated with . maybe trialpay did n't properly vet them or inform you . most people would n't bother taking their time to email you , but they 're not me . a movie ticket ( or 2 ) would be nice , but imho you needed to know regardless .	0

I use Maca powder everyday in my morning smoothie . . . . .it is packed with nutrients to bring our systems up to par and running well . It 's a Superfood which is instrumental in sustaining energy and offering us a bioavailable plant protein which is easy for the body to assimilate . It is rich in amino acids , fatty acids , vitamins and minerals and it 's a fertility booster .This is the brand I generally use and I like the mild flavor . It should be taken in small amounts until you work your way up to one teaspoon a day . Taking it during the morning hours is best as it does provide energy and if taken later in the day , is known to keep people up with insomnia . I always take it before 1100 am just to make sure . There are several plant based products which I swear by and this is one of them . Keep it simple and keep it organic ! This product is NONGMO , Vegan , Gulten Free and Organic . . . .a product of Peru . It 's always fresh with an expiration date several years away . The taste is mild , nutty , malted . . .it 's a bit hard to explain , I ca n't pick out the taste in a protein drink .

My son is into the skinny jeans , but I wo n't buy him the super skinny ones . These ones are a good compromise between him and me . He said his friends at school have the same pair and they all think they are cool . This really surprised me since the Levi brand has n't really been the 34cool34 choice for several years . I really like these . I also bough a black pair of the 511 these are 510 and those ones are way too baggy . I would go with these if you 're trying to decide between the two .	1

So I schedule some maintenance . They asked if I had parts or should they order . I told them to order . I wait over two weeks for my appointment . First I arrive and am told I might have to leave the bike for a day or so . For an hour and a half appointment ? ? ? Why ? Because a rider who is traveling and broke down is getting his bike fixed . Well , that 's great customer service for him at my expense . So I state that I will be waiting for pickup today . I wait FOUR HOURS . . . only to find out that they do n't have my parts ! ? ! ? ! ? What the fk ! ? ! ? ! I gave them my phone number specifically if there was a problem . I 'm not a rocket scientist or even a mechanic , but not having the parts to do the damn job IS A PROBLEM ! I drove over a hundred miles to have the work done that I scheduled . But all is not lost , as a consolation prize I 'm offered 20 off of parts and they will order them and we can reschedule the work . I 'm assuming I 'll have to wait another two weeks for that appointment as well . Needless to say I am not happy . Epic fail Westside . We had taken vacation time and planned a lot of riding . None of that is going to happen now . Thanks a bunch . We bought the bike from you and gave you loyalty because of that . Big mistake on our part . Should 've learned our lesson when you screwed up the VIN on our sales paperwork and title paperwork . Lesson learned now . I hope your traveling rider got their work done and off on their adventure . Looks like we will be staying home .	0

went to see wolverine on 7 27 2013 with my 3 boys ( all 13 and above ) . the movie had started and about 5 minutes in ( after previews ) a family of 6 came in and crammed in around my family . lots of noise and interference . the dad was a big guy and completely blocked my 13 year old son . i changed seats with him . after 15 minutes the man got up to go the the bathroom or something and then his wife changed seats in front of my son ( also blocking him ) . i asked the kids to please keep it down . did not help . noise was a constant low hum even with my hearing loss ! me and my family could not follow the movie due to all of this . wanted to tell the manager , but could not find them during and afterwards wanted to get home and let off some steam . so disappointing . advice , if you really want to enjoy your movie do not go to this movie theatre .	0

Service department is horrible ! ! ! Dropped my car with Joey who gave me an estimate the next day . I told him about another issue the car was having and he said he 'd call me back with price . I NEVER heard from him again . I called back asking for Joey and left a message for him . Over a week later and still no Joey . I called back again asking if Joey still worked there and was told yes . I left another message for him with no results . He actually had another person call me two days later , I asked where was Joey and was told he 'd asked this person to call me . He knew he did n't want to hear my wrath . What a joke this Joey guy in service . If you want to wait a long time for service , then Baker Cadillac is for you . Remember ask for Joey , Lol .	0
This Laza Extended Battery Silicone Case fits myPandosilan 3500mAh Extended Battery for HTC Evo 4 G Cover with 2 Year Guarantee / Warrantycover perfectly . I also have aSeidio Innocell 3500 mAh ExtendedLife Battery for HTC EVO 4 G Blackcover , but it is shaped differently and this case fit too loosely .This is a good looking case I ordered the Red one that is thick enough to give me some peace of mind about the protective factor , while still allowing for access to the USB charger port , headphone jack , front and back cameras , camera lights , microphone , speaker , and the EVO 's built in stand . The silicon feels a little slick to the touch , but it does nicely grip the dashboard of my car .I am very pleased with this in both performance and value ! Highly Recommended ! CFH	1

I own several pairs of Fit Flops and love them , but these shoes allow my foot to slide too far forward with no support for the arch . It 's as though the top of the shoe is too large . The fit is completely different than the Gogh Clogs that I love . My toes touched the end of the shoe inside , but the shoe extended a good inch behind my heel . They were instantly uncomfortable . I am returning them .	0
After reading most of the reviews , I decided to purchase this case for my droid X2 phone , to mount on my bike . First , the case is way too big for this phone 4 .3 screen . You will have about 1 / 2 extra room on each side . Secondly , and most importantly , it is extremely difficult to slide the unlock bar when your phone goes to sleep mode . There were a few times where I had to stop riding and take the phone out to unlock it . But to push the icons , it works each time . So you would have to leave the phone screen on all the time to fix this problem . The good part about this case is that it does not vibrate and has not fallen off the bike , so far . For 25 , I was very dissappointed . And I am looking for another one right now .	0

I use both this Alphabrace and the Futuro Moderate stabilizing back brace 27 .99amazon . Both are adequate for lightduty back support and thin enough to fit under slacks / shirts . However , the designs are different in several respects . Where the Futuro has a molded lumbar support , this Alphabrace does not . The Futuro is thinner all the way around 8 at the lumbar to 3 at abdomen , where the Alphabrace is 10 at the lumbar and 5 at abdomen . The Alphabrace provides the greater support all around . I wore the Futuro for several months , initially , then the Alphabrace for awhile , then interchangeably . After several month 's use , I would give the slight preference at this point to the Alphabrace which is actually less expensive even when shipping is taken into account .So , if mechanical support in the lumbar area is needed , Futuro would be my first choice . For abdomen support as well as lumbar , Alphachoice would be my first choice . I have found both to be helpful . Both have ventilated straps to reduce heat build up that seem to me to be equally effective . The Velcro is more securely attached to the Alphachoice , which also seems to stretch a bit less than the Futuro . The Futuro is slightly more comfortable to wear because of softer materials .I do n't think you can go too far wrong with either . I 'm certainly pleased with both .Note that the Alphabrace runs slightly larger than the Futuro maybe by a belt size or two .	1

Otterbox should have given this a whole new name because it is so superior to the earlier iPhone 4 Defender cases . There are now 3 versions of the iPhone 4 Defender case original for ATT iPhone 4 , the universal for ATT and Verizon iPhone 4 , and this new Defender for the iPhone 4S it fits everybody ! The best features of this new redesign are a dramatically improved holster no more oilslick effect under the builtin screen protector dramatically improved silicone material that does n't absorb lint and pull your pocket inside out much better design where surrounding silicone stays tight to the inner case unlike the previous versions that became loose and sloppy fantastic fit and feel .Best of all REDUCED BULK and INCREASED SCREEN OPENING SIZE so you do n't lose the elegance of the iPhone 4 4S when they are in the Defender .BE SURE TO REMOVE any screen protector from your iPhone BEFORE you put it in this case ! This is BY FAR THE BEST iPhone case money can buy !	1

After losing one of my micro usb cords on a business trip , I was forced to purchase what cords the hotel guest shop had available . They had a retractable microusb cord and I tried it out , surprisingly it worked and was a lot less cord clutter too . After that I knew I had to find more of these clever litter usb cords . I decided to purchase the Lenmar cause they looked more durable , and when they arrived I was right . These are much more durable than the flimsy one I purchased at the hotel . So far I have used these cords to power my Samsung S3 smartphone , and my Kindle Fire without any issues . These are awesome for travel , and fit nicely in any pocket . Highly recommend .	1

Had another great experience at SM Lexus service center , this time I took my car in for stereo issues and getting new tires . Victor , the service manager was very professional and great with customer service . Carlos Paleyo was our service rep , he informed me every step of the way of what 's going on with my car . Moises was helping me with my tires . All in all , they went above and beyond for me and I 'm very happy with the services I received . Why would you want to go anywhere else besides SM Lexus ?	1

A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night . They have found goblins , trolls , werewolves , and lions , tigers , and bears . . . .if you wish to believe their tales ! They are small in size but very , very bright and the light projects for a great distance . We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees .They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by . They do that even in the daylight ! The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use . They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games . That is the biggest benefit in my opinion .	1

This worked for my phone for a while though only charged to 90 , then it started lighting blue or green , I forget , and switching to red , then back , then to red again .I contacted Lerway through Amazon and was completely ignored , and now I see now that the page I bought it from is removed . It probably had a boatload of negative feedback .After using this charger , my phone battery was shot . I got 812 hours from a full charge before this charger by usb charging , then after this charger , I would get 4 hours out of a full charge whether using USB or wireless to charge it . I strongly suspect this charger damaged my phone 's battery with the on / off charging for one or two nights . The phone was only a month old when I tried this charger .I replaced the phone with an exact duplicate , and I 'm getting over 12 hours from a full charge now , while also using a different brand of Qi charger .You might be having ok luck with this charger , but I would n't use it unless you 're ready for it to hose your phone .	0

Pros My wife likes the scent It was free from Amazonvine It really works for the entire day Not sticky and gummyCons None so farMy wife is very particular about her deodorant not wanting the flower fresh or the just cleaned linen sheet smell .

She pleased with it 's performance and would look for this specific brand to purchase in the stores .	1

Do n't get me started on what all goes down the toilet , that goes without saying . But when you have a family of four the germs that surround the toilet are modified . I could n't wait to put Flushy to the test and see how well the product really worked .So , I put the pouch in the toilet let it dissolve and took the brush and went to town cleaning . Of course , I did n't have to put much elbow grease into the process as Flushy seemed to work very well in the toilet . I could tell that the water did flow much more easier while flushing which let me know that it did work very well in the pipes . I am very happy with Flushy and would have to say it is a must have toilet and pipe cleaner .	1

I read many positive reviews on this bra , which is why I was surprised to be disappointed once I put it on .It is comfortable and very stretchie all over , fits true to size , my complaint is in the cups , there is no support at all , some ladies stated this bra gave the the look of torpedo boobs . . . That may be an improvement over having them look like a couple of wet noodles ! I was looking for true support without under wires , and this does NOT deliver . Not even worth the postage to send it back ! Good thing I also ordered a Glamorise Magic Lift , which is AWESOME , I will be ordering more of those and no more of these .	0

Sooo , I started using eye drops in college when I started smoking that which is now legally being dispensed in Colorado . All other eye drops are crap and did n't make my eyes white enough .

In fact , even though I no longer smoke , I still use these drops because I love how white they make my eyes . I also use them when my eyes feel dry and they work well for alleviating that problem .	1

I have been to this dealership twice so far and each time , I have had a terrible experience . The first time , over a year ago , I was just beginning my new car search and told the manager that I specifically wanted to see the new Mazda CX5 I have been doing a lot of research up to this point and narrowed it down to that car at the time . Needless to say , I did n't see a single new one that day because he pushed me right to the used car section and left me . He did n't even walk me into the showroom to see any of their new cars . To be honest , I was completely offended . The second time , less than a month ago , now ready to purchase a car , I decided to give them another chance since they had the new 2017 CX5 with the options that I wanted . The first salesman we spoke to was great and let me explore the car at my own pace and test drive it for awhile . However , once we started talking price and the managers stepped in , my experience went straight downhill . They would not answer simple maintenance questions , insisting that the car be brought back to their service department even though I do all of my own maintenance at home and just wanted a better idea of how easy the car would be to work with . They also were extremely pushy on buying the car rather than discussing options . I understand that it is all part of being a car salesman but , this was way over the top and the pressure completely turned me off . Needless to say , I will be purchasing my car elsewhere and would not recommend this dealership to my friends and family most of whom are loyal Mazda owners .	0
I bought Hyundai from this place last year . When I was dealing with the finance manger he said I recommend our extended warranty . I trade my truck in every 2 years and had n't bought it . He said its like 1 , 500 . 00 but really good because if you need it your covered . So I purchased it and now my truck is in the shop with the AC not working . Well service guy is saying that my extended warranty does n't want to cover it because service is n't sure where the leak is coming from . Service want me to agree to pay 1400 . 00 since the extended warranty wo nt . Service claims that there is 8 other customers dealing with extended warranty not wanting to pay for repairs . Truck has been in shop since Monday morning and its now its Tue evening and still no rental or AC working on my truck . I guess that South Point Hyundai want us to pay for repairs when I bought extended warranty and drive my family around in 100 pulse temp . WOW I will update when I find out what South Point Hyundai is going to do .	0
recently got it for an S3 that I refurbished after breaking the screen . S3 and S4 have so few differences it does n't make sense to upgrade just yet . Though the S4 has a flat screen and S3 has a curved screen , thus I 've been frustrated thus far with any screen protector for the S3 . After breaking the screen once I 've decided to try again with iSmooth 's version . Comes with 3 screens which is nice .APPLICATIONIf goes on well . 2 films to remove that are labeled 1 and 2 which makes it easy . make sure the use the dust protector if you notice dust under the screen protector I use the sticker to apply directly to the screen protector surface and it tends to preferentially take off the dust .EDGE LIFTINGS3 's problem is edge lifting over time . This version i 've noticed is cut smaller than the screen , thus about 23 mm away from the screen edge . this is important because that is also where the S3 starts to curve downwards and where i 've had problems in the past with the edges lifting up . i do n't see any lifting yet but time will tell . I will update the review accordinglyFEELfeels very smooth on the finger . touch function works very well . clarity is excellent without hazing or reflection .Thus far I would recommend . good price . decent quality thus far . attention to the edge . . .	1

I trus Lysol throughout my home and I love these Lysol Lemon Lime wipes ! They work well and leave everything I use them on smelling fresh and clean . Other wipes do not disinfect so beware of imposters ! These Lysol wipes KILL GERMS and clean at the same time . The price on Amazon is also great and fast free delivery makes shopping for them on Amazon a nobrainer ! I highly recommend this product .	1
Motorola P513 Car ChargerThe P513 is a microUSB car charger that works on the Droid , Droid2 , and DroidX . I ca n't figure out a way to change the inline fuse if there is one , but it is cheap enough to be used as a disposable car charger . The blue LEDlit Motorola logo is a nice touch , as well as the wire tether that is included .Pros Gets the job done at a great price , looks greatCons Does n't appear to be an easy way to change the fuse if any but it is not a big dealOverall 5 / 5 stars	1

OtterBox has good reputation for quality cell phone cases . I have been known to drop my phone so I wanted one that would protect my Galaxy SIII if I did so . However , the tabs for the on / off and the volume on the case did not line up with the corresponding buttons on the phone . No matter how I tried to position it , they did not work . The case is useless . Unfortunately , for me , I put the screen protector on before I put the case on so now I can not return it . Very disappointed in this design !	0
I love theses styles of hats . This one is a little plasticky in the coating , but the faux fur is great and nice and thick . Once you snap the strap together , you are definitely going to stay warmbut do n't drive with this hat on as the faux fur will obstruct your view . Additionally , if you are walking somewhere seedy late at night , it may obstruct your view and I always like to look at my surroundings cause I live in a very urban area . The only thing I am waiting to see is if the clip will last . I had previously owned a hat similar to this one and the little plastic clip broke so I could still wear the hat , but could n't seal the warmth in . Especially once you close the hat , it will definitely keep you warm .	1

I ordered two of the Columbia Men 's 38 mm Cotton Washed Webbing , Beige , 42 . I have only worn one so far and that one has been a sour experience . It is very difficult to lock and to unlock . When I attempt to fasten the belt , either the top or bottom of the moveable lock sticks causing a very bad bind . After fighting it for a minuet or so , I can get the lock to straighten up andthen it will move back to the locked position . If I am lucky it will hold , if not , I have to fiddle with it for another minuet or so to get it to hold . This might start moving back and forth properly after awhile , but I should n't have to fight it every time I use it . I will give it a few more tries to be fair to the seller , but if it does n't start locking and unlocking smoothly , I will most surely return it .

I never , in all those years , had trouble with the military buckle This buckle appears to be totally unacceptable .	0

I doubt I 'll use this regularly . It has too many functions and waiting 4 seconds for it to become useful is long time . It assumes I want to know what the last temperature was every time I turn it on . The constant beeping is totally irritating . I 'll probably just toss this in the trash and look for an analog thermometer I can time for myself in peace and quiet . Perhaps if they had another option to turn the noise off .	0
I have slightly cold sensitive teeth so I was a little worried because I have read that sometimes these have a side effect of causing increased sensitivitiy if you wear them too long . As such I was very diligent about not keeping them on longer than the recommended 30 minutes . After three days I can tella huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth . I am really happy and will definitely consider using them again the next time I feel like my teeth are looking a little too yellow .	1

The product arrived at the perfect time it was waiting for me at my office after a Thanksgiving week spent struggling with laminate flooring easy to install my a ! , stirring up decades worth of allergens while removing the old carpeting , exchanging airborne pathogens with already sick family members , and gently advising my little ones to STAY AWAY FROM THE SAW ! My throat was terribly sore , and though somewhat dubious about the product 's claims , I was out of sick days and ready to try ANYTHING .And it WORKED ! I found the product easy to use and astonishingly soothing , frankly more soothing than the salt water gargles I mix myself . I 've gone from regarding this as a frivolous product for the Rich and Lazy to a Necessity that I 'll keep stockpiled at my office and haul with me on all future trips . The fully labeled 0 .4 oz . ampules should pose no difficulty in air travel . Other formulations are available Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse , Allergy and Hayfever , 12 Single Use Doses Pack of 3 , Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse , Cold and Flu , 12 Single Use Doses Pack of 3 , and Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse , NightTime Formula , 0 .4Ounce Ampules in 12Count Boxes Pack of 3 , differing only in the herbal ingredients , but that may be more specialization than most people need .Note A number of reviewers have reported trouble opening the ampules based on my experience this might be due to skimming the instructions . The ampules ARE easy to open but not very intuitive . Unless you habitually rip phonebooks in half , you can forget about tearing off the tips you must instead , as instructed , twist off the tips by turning the arrow tip in half turns clockwise or counterclockwise until the plastic tears back from the slits , and it comes off in your hand . For some reason if you are experiencing difficulty with a given ampule it may work better to reverse your usual direction and twist it off in the opposite direction . If you have the hand strength to twist it half a turn and hold the tip until you reposition your fingers for the next half turn , you can open this product .Note Some reviewers have mentioned how they prefer their salt water gargles heated . Well , if you have access to a heating element and a safe cup for same , you can have your gargle heated as desired , too . Simply squirt your opened ampule into the cup and heat it to preference . Just be sure NOT to heat the ampule ! Note Some reviewers have complained about the taste . They might want to try the other formulations to see if they can find one more to their liking .	1

I purchased a 2013 Ford Focus from this dealership with an extended warranty that was completely useless . I was told that anything under the hood was covered however when I needed service it was not covered . Shocking not really because that is not even the only problem . I was never told that even though the sold me the car they can only do the oil changes and tire rotations on the vehicle . I was told to call the Ford dealership and I did . They do not even have the courtesy to do that even thought they sold the policy . To top it off every time I call to complain ask a question or try to get a resolution I am transferred to so many different people and finally hung up on . so buyer beware They lie and refuse to deal with the problem once there is one . Everyone I spoke with hung up on me so fast during each transfer to a line that was usually one where I had to wait to reexplain my problem . I tried to report them to the BBB but as luck would have it they are not there . The funny thing is that Ford dealership was much more cooperative and helpful . They are on the BBB website . A company like this people need to steer clear of because they will not solve your issues or help they will blame someone else and act like there is nothing they can do . If I could rate zero I would .	0

I have dry eyes and my wife has contacts so we regularly use Visine products . I get seasonal allergies and my eyes are the worst . I have another product that I have used in the past that works alright also much more expensive . These eye drops offered quick , almost instant relief , and lasted through a whole work day for me . My wife has also used it on occasion and likes how well it works . I would highly recommend picking a package up .	1
i am extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect . i just ordered tickets and the site took me to a page that says sorry , the order you are attempting to view either failed or does not exist . my confirmation email link opens the same error page and yet my card has been charged . there are 900 people in queue for chat before me and the 866 857 5191 support number has gone to a busy signal in 5 call attempts . i now must stand in line at a kiosk or attendant booth and hope that the ticket is actually processed . i paid an additional 2 to fandango for a convenience fee and there is no convenience . i will most likely not use this service in the future nor recommend it to anyone based on my current experience .	0
so what is the point ?	0
a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind	1
a convenience charge makes sense for your site once i understood your business . however , i was unaware of an additional charge until i received an email confirmation after i had already purchased the tickets . i had to literally research in order to find out what the extra charge was for and why . please , for the betterment of your business make this service charge more aptly known to your customers . if you do not , then the business is no better than a polite yet sneaky thief i 'm sure some like myself would not mind paying if we just knew that we needed to pay and could add those costs into our budgets . if i overlooked this clause in your small print i apologize , but , to continue as a customer , i would still appreciate a notice before finalizing my purchasing . thank you	0

Comfort My 8 year old son has some sensory issues when it comes to socks and shoes . They always seem to bother him . I bought these for him and really hoped they would n't bother him . I should also note I bought them a half size bigger because you know how fast kids grow ! Fingers were crossed . Well , the morning came and time to get ready for school . He puts them on and no complaints at all . Not that morning and not since we got them . That in itself is a big thumbs up for me ! Price The price was also very reasonable , especially now that we are transitioning from little kid shoes to big kid shoes and that 's where I 've noticed the prices jump up . These were under 50 .Shipping No problem ! Fast and packaging was fine , not a pain to open the box .Bottom Line Highly recommended .	1
They look exactly as pictured . Very pretty , good quality too . But man oh man , either I have the smallest nipples in the universe or these are huge . I could wear this as a ring around my pinky . And no , my boobs are not microscopic . Nor , are my nipples . I have a C cup , and these just do n't fly . Not that nipple size is relative to boob size . . . . . As far as I know . I 've tried bending the items to clamp smaller , but no luck . For now they have joined my drawer of lost jewelry .If you think you have bigger nipples , or maybe you can pull off some serious RT these might just work for you . I wish you luck .	0

I had to come back and change my first review . At the beginning when things were going great , everyone was really pleasant . I purchased a car from this dealership this past October . Since that time my car has broken down on me 3 times each time I 've paid to have it towed to Nissan where they claimed the fixed the issue . One time was in the middle of 85 in rush hour traffic . Guess who cared , not Nissan ! ! ! I need a car for work and I have two small children , I explained all this to them and they never offered me a loaner car . In fact they told me , we do n't need you anymore so I guess I 'm supposed to walk home , 20 miles , with two small children . Now , my car is back in the shop , no transportation for work , to take my children to school , or anything . Oh , and guess who cares , not Nissan . Its very unfortunate that dealerships get away with treating people any kind of way after taking their money . Save yourself the trouble , once you purchase , do n't look for anything else from them . Contrary to what they say , you are NOT important .	0

After reading the reviews , my guess was that it at least had to help with odor , but I am totally surprised how well ! I gave up using any conventional deodorants , let alone antiperspirants a few years ago for every reason under the sun . I have tried a few of the more natural brands like Tom 's and Natures Gate sticks , but was never impressed since most of the time the scents would change to something gross throughout the day , whereas my natural scent without actually smells better . I finally just gave up using deodorant entirely during the cooler seasons , because I despise deodorants , everything about them I hate . This is the only brand of crystal deodorant I have tried , but I must say , it is amazing and nothing like traditional deodorants . First of all it actually works . It does nt clump or feel gooey on your skin , it does nt get smudges or stains on your clothing and it does nt have any odor itself . While it does nt claim to be an antiperspirant , I can tell a difference in the amount of perspiration , although it does nt feel like it 's plugging up my skin . It 's as if the salt it 's made from is causing the moisture to dry faster . Anyways , i m completely sold . The ca n't foresee trying any other deodorant in my future .	1

I decided to try the Merkur blades that came with my wonderful Merkur Slant . I was quite surprised when they were some of the worst blades that I 've ever used . They were so bad in fact , that I threw them away midshave and switched to an Astra Platinum to finish the shave without issue .These blades seem to caused a large amount of razor drag despite being in a very aggressive razor which lead to irritation postshave . I feel like they are quite dull and in the bottom quarter of the 30 some odd razor brands that I 've tried . Needless to say , I 'm quite disappointed since I 'm quite impressed by the quality of Merkur 's other products .	0

If you realy think the 5 star reviews are real , READ THIS FIRSTI read the Puma Punku review and i would have to agree , Lexus of Nashville is a mess . Large turnover of personnel , poor communication and record keeping of service and when I was asked to bring the car back the next day to finish a warranted repair ! I was pissed . Was told they were out of loaner vehicles . If i am told a loaner policy , by God you better honor it . Well I was up at the Keeneland Racecourse in Lexington , Kentucky for the past 2 weeks and stopped into the Lexus dealer . OH MY GOD ! WHAT A CHANGE ! Now the service manager at Lexus of Lexington offered to PICK UP my car in Hopkinsville , KY and leave a loaner . Buy Buy Nashville , the only true effort I see you do is create fake 5 star reviews . Why do I believe that ? Because the GM has not returned a call in 3 months .	0
I brought my car here with the best intentions to have a strange noise investigated . Upon arrival , and despite four employees listening to it and agreeing that something did n't sound right , they were unable to replicate it the next day . When I picked the car up , it was shoehorned so tightly among the other cars , it took 20 minutes to retrieve it . After ten minutes in traffic the noise returned , which tells me the dealership did n't even look for the problem . I wo n't be back , and I recommend anyone who drives an RS car to look elsewhere for service .	0
Like another reviewer I purchased these for my Omron pedometer . I read the review before I bought the batteries and thought short lived batteries would not be that big of a deal . They are . Everreadys last 6 months or more . One of these lasted two months . Another lasted about a month . The rest have lasted a week or so at best . This week I am on my third battery . In seven months , I have been through 12 of these . One star is generous for these gems . Not a good deal . I will buy a recognized brand from now on .	0

I usually use Stayfree , but somehow I must have gotten mixed up on what I normally get . These are so bulky I feel like I 'm wearing a diaper . I only used them because I was desperate not even comfortable for overnight wear .	0
Bought these as a gift for the boyfriend . He 's had a lot of trouble with blistered heels by all the shoes he 's worn in the past . I bought myself a pair of NB running shoes and they did n't rub my heels at all . I took a chance and bought these for him it was in his wishlist along with a few other running shoes different brands . Turns out these did n't blister him either ! So glad ! DHe said they are a great fit for his size 12 feet . The orange is very vibrant against the dark charcoal gray / black base . This shoe is better looking in person .	1
Green Gobbler works wonders ! I had a terribly clogged kitchen sink which was hardly draining , all kitchen waste with vegetable fibers , soap scum etc . had got trapped giving out an odor too . Green Gobbler came into my mercy and cleared the clog completely . It was very easy to use , just to drop in a handful of the crystals into the sink with a bit of water to activate . The results were quick and very very efficient . Within minutes of flushing off with hot water , the entire clog had gone off .What I like the best in this product is that it works the green way , without any nasty harsh chemicals . Its safe for kids and pets therefore with least impact on the environment . This product is handy for the household and quite economical to others in the market .	1

These are pretty good basic walking shoes . They do n't have the fit and comfort of a 150 new Balance shoe but for what they are , they are pretty good . This is my third pair over the last 8 years or so and I would n't have bought these except they were on sale . The insoles are pretty weak if you have flat feet so I remove the NB insole and use Superfeet Black insoles . These last about as long as the shoes so it works out pretty good .	1
how very deceptive of you to have an all theaters tab ! ! we bought my mother a fandango gift card without realizing that your all theaters tab does n't list theaters that accept fandango . our 73 year old mother has gone from theater to theater to find someone in her area that accepts fandango and no one does . the only place that does is on the bad side of town , which she does n't feel safe going to . you should not list any theater that does not work with your shady company . i am highly dissatisfied . i called customer no service and they said there is nothing that can do for me . thanks for tricking me out of my money . you should be ashamed .	0

David the service manager actually told me to go to auto zone and service my car instead of doing his job and ordering a part . Everytime you go for an oil change there is always and I mean always something wrong with . . . that is added onto the oil change . Solicit you at least two to three times a week even after you say stop wasting your time and displeased with the product . Sorento was part of the recall and they put me in a compact car and said I would have to pay for the upcharge to go to an suv and talked to Shane and said tough that s the way it goes or do I just want my Sorento back with no engine repairs and endanger my life with a faulty engine . They also conveniently have a trade in of your recalled vehicle and place in a brand new one with more financing and years added to your loan with no repurcussions of course for Kia Schaumburg . Scam artists !	0

If you get your car serviced at South county Bommarito MAZDA / Chevrolet this is worth reading for you . Yesterday around 10 a . m . my fiance took his car to South County Bommarito Mazda running just fine to get something non engine related looked at . So he gets a call saying it 's ready to be picked up about an hour later , so I drop him off at Mazda to pick it up . He gets in starts the car and you can tell just buy listening that his car can not drive out of the garage . Before we dropped it off it ran silently He said to the service guy that he dropped it off and it was running perfectly and that while it 's in their care they 're responsible for returning it in what anyone would expect , better condition . Not an undriveable vehicle . SO my fianc pops the hood and says that the main engine belt is off , and that he is n't accepting his car in this condition . My fianc was speaking to the HEAD of SERVICE Kevin McCauley and Told Kevin He 's leaving his car there for them to fix . Kevin said well we did n't do that to your carside noteIf there is ANY grey area about what happened to MY BRAND NEW car when I dropped it off in YOUR care then that is who is responsible for whatever happened to it . As a customer who has tons of friends and family who gets their car serviced there you should WANT to fix the issue because I 'm a loyal customer and get all service on my car done at your location ! Anyway so we go pick the car up later that day around 445 pm , we go to pick up the keys and they said it 's going to be 175 , but we took 50 off for the special we have going . My fianc says I do n't think I should have to pay that amount when it happened in your care . THE HEAD OF SERVICE says , Well I 'm going to tell you this , if you do n't pay this do n't bring any of your cars back to this location ever again . So I say It happened in your care , when I take a loaner car from Mazda then anything that happens to your car is my responsibility right ? Kevin says yes but based off of your logic you could be parked at an Applebee 's and if something happens to your car it 's my fault . I said That does n't make any sense , my logic was I take care of your car when I borrow them and you should take care of mine when I TRUST to leave it with the people who are supposed to be FIXING IT . He continued to disagree and tell me that he is n't responsible for the cars brought to him . So if you take your cars you SOUTH COUNTY BOMMARITO MAZDA / Chevrolet then just so you know the service department is n't responsible for what happens to your vehicle when its there , words of wisdom from the head of service Kevin McCauley Do n't worry I 'll drive the extra 25 minutes to west county since I ca n't TRUST you to do YOUR job .	0

Everyone at Audi Allentown was very friendly . I had multiple people just say hello and shake my hand . Marcus was a great salesman . He was very patient with my indecisiveness and wanting to drive a few different vehicles . He also answered all of my questions which was a lot and was very knowledgeable with the vehicles . They gave me a good trade in value for my car as well . They worked with me on prices , which was very helpful due to me being a new graduate . Highly recommend Audi Allentown ! The location is easily accessible and easy to find . You will not go wrong ! OH and I LOVE my new Audi ! ! ! ! Thanks again Audi Allentown !	1

Last week I purchased the Jambox on a whim as it was on sale at Costco for 230 including the travel case . I then started to wonder whether one of the Bose units might have been a better choice . So , I brought the Jambox down to the local Bose store and compared the three units sidebyside . All units sounded very good so I think any opinions on sound quality is very subjective . Personally , the Jambox sounded best to my ears a bit crisper and purer than the two Bose models IMHO . Both of the Bose units sounded similar the difference being the Soundlink III has more power behind it . The salesperson said it has 4 speakers vs . 2 for the Mini .If you 're going to use the speaker within a few feet of yourself , such as when working at a desk , the Jambox has an amazing feature called Live Audio . At first I thought was a marketing gimmick . However , I 've been using it for the past few days and it 's amazing ! When you activate Live Audio , it makes the audio sound like it 's coming from all directions , like you sitting in a concert hall . I 'm listening to it right now and it 's really incredible . You only get the effect when you 're very close to the speaker . So if you 're planning to use it at your desk , I 'd definitely go for the Big Jambox .If you 're looking for the best sound quality , think about your room size . If you 're primarily going to use it in a small to medium sized rooms , the Bose Mini or the Big Jambox are all you need . However , if you 're going to use it in larger rooms or really want to crank it up , the Jawbone or Soundlink III would be a better choice .How to decide ? Small / Medium rooms Bose Mini is much more portable than the Big Jambox but it 's not much of a hassle to move the Jambox around the house . But , if you 're going to be taking it out with you , the Mini would be much easier to carry around and hence a better choice . For me , the superior sound quality of Jambox is worth the extra bulk when compared to the Bose Mini . Plus , you can crank up the Jambox much louder than the Bose Mini without any loss in sound quality .Medium / Large rooms The Soundlink III and the Jambox do a nice job for background music or when cranking it up . For me , the Jambox gets the edge in sound quality . Also , the Jambox is smaller and IMHO , better looking . It can be placed outofthe way and is less noticeable . The smaller size makes it easier to transport if you 're planning to take it out anywhere . The look of the Soundlink III reminds me of a portable AM / FM Cassette radio from the 70 's whereas the Jambox is more stealth . Both batteries are supposed to last in the 12 hour range so no significant difference there . Sound and size makes the Big Jambox my choice .All of these units are very nice and I think you 'll be happy with any of them . For me , the Jambox has better sound , Live Audio is amazing , it 's more versatile use in any size room , and looks better than the Bose Soundlink III . Plus , given the price , I think you get more for your money with the Jambox .I hope this comparison helps you decide . Good luck with your decision !	1
Purchased my BMW here new in 2015 and the purchase process was super easy . Fast forward two years later and the bike is experiencing issues that require warranty claims . It took 3 months to get it back and when I did they had cobbled it together with parts from different years , important bolts like the muffler securing bolt were left loose , parts were missing or not properly reinstalled and one warranty issue was n't fixed . I ended up fixing it myself . Dealer claimed parts were on order to resolve the missing parts but several months later I have n't heard back from them . I 've emailed , I 've called . Simply ignored or lied to about the person not being there or at lunch , etc . They wo n't even provide the paperwork showing what they 've done so I have records of it for my files . I would not recommend this dealership as I do n't feel their leadership have the interests of their customers at heart which is a shame because some of the folks there seem genuinely nice and customer oriented . Rated One Star because it 's a required minimum to post a review .	0

It would be my preference to write about the technical performance of this headset , but regrettably it 's design makes it uncomfortable to the point of irrelevance to wear with glasses . This is obviously a problem for me as I wear prescription lenses , but even wearing sunglasses which one might want to do when driving and wearing a blue tooth headset renders this device practically unusable .It is conceivable that I have freakishly small ears , but I doubt it , and the result is an almost laughable design flaw .	0

I first noticed upon arrival that the fabric looks , and feels cheap . When I tried it on I discovered that it was very difficult to tie in the various styles shown , and when I did manage to tie it , it looked horribly unflattering . Also , this top is not good for any woman with a cup size larger than B , and I would say that might even be pushing it . Lastly , I should note that I bought it in a larger size than I normally wear , and I still ran into all of these issues . If I could give zero stars in this review , I would .	0

Good product , good quality . If you have a ford or Lincoln product with a 7 or 8 inch screen , it will not work in your vehicle . It does clamp in just fine , but because ford / Lincoln put the hard buttons on the upper edge of the cd slot , you find that you can not push any button and , in many cases , several of the buttons are already being pressed by this unit .Again , good quality but just will not work with ford / Lincoln with Navigation .	0

I loved the set , it was as stated , I was very sad that the size ran so small . I had to return it , which was very qucik and easy , great customer service . I do plan to purchase more items , just keep in mind that when you purchase rings it would be better to order 1 size larger .	1
First let me say I 'm a big fan of Jarrow products until I hit this one . I 've certainly given them a shot . I 've gone through maybe 10 boxes of the darned things working on some digestive problems . Well I would still be using them but I on a whim bought some live cultured raw sauerkraut . I liked it so went through a second jar and bingo things started and have continued to improve with my digestion . I can even see it in my stool size and consistency . So I can only agree with the other reviews who think this product does n't do squat .	0

What could be cuter for a Victorian or steampunk outfit than a pair of simple netted gloves with ribbon ties ? I purchased a pair on a lark for a Hallowe'en costume . Given the low price and cheap materials , I was not expecting miracles , but at least something that would give me more than one use if I were careful . They have , though not the way I expected .The gloves are made for very small hands , and my dainty fingers were cramped by the seams of the cutoff fingers . The bottom of the gloves barely reached my palms , and the mesh fabric rolled up very easily . Tightening the ribbons to fit the gloves better does n't help one bit , putting a constricting bracelet around the base of your wrists . I spent half the night pulling the gloves down and trying to fix their position . They fit for about two minutes , or until making the slightest motion like reaching for a glass or picking up something . I finally tossed them in my purse and gave up .A complete waste of money all around , and I wish I could 've taken them back . Good for your tween , maybe , but not worth it for an adult .	0

No matter what I do or how I try to apply this item to my IPOD Touch screen I get air bubbles . I have gone over the directions many times and used the tools they gave me but still air bubbles . I have used other screen savers before and these rank right with them . Worthless when it comes to air bubbles . Just can not get them out . The screen saver itself seems really nice and does a good job if you want to put up with the air bubbles . If it were not for the bubbles I would have rated this item a 5 . Keep trying .	0

Leather wallet flip case . . .if you read the description , it 's fake leather . That 's somewhat misleading to begin with . I just received this item and it 's not even fake leather . . .it 's rubber . Rubber is not leather , nor fake leather .The speaker slot cutout does n't actually line up with the speaker at all .All that aside , it 's a decent case . Not great , but decent .Update I 've lowered this to one star as it ca n't even be removed ! I 've been fighting with this case for a half hour and managed to scratch the phone , crack the case , but not budge it in the slightest . Impressive in its own way , but not good .	0
I had tremendous problems trying to use this Iodine solution , because the dropper bottle they now have the liquid in is not the one which you squeeze at the top as shown in the picture on Amazon . It is one where you turn the bottle over and the liquid is supposed to drip out of the hole .It did not drip out of the hole . In fact it did nothing . Even shaking the bottle when it was upside down did not allow the liquid to drip out .A total waste of time and money .	0

This skirt looks nothing like the photo . It 's very seethrough and flat . You can see the cheap looking lining clearly through the few layers of voile . And that 's somewhat seethrough too . The waist has an elastic band running through it , but since it 's not sewn to the waist material , it twists and bunches up inside instead of laying flat . This might be good to layer underneath another skirt , but I would never wear it alone . All I can think is that the models are wearing 2 or 3 of these skirts at once for the amount of coverage and poofiness that the photos are showing .I know , I know . . .what did I expect for 13 ?	0

I 've been in this area for over 7 years for my job . I have used Suttle as my go to business for purchase and repairs of my vehicles .

I ordered July 16th and I am still waiting for them . I was supposed to receive them July 23rd and Fedex could n't find my house so here I am still waiting . Do n't these trucks have GPS ? I will update when I receive these sneakers . Well I finally received them July 24th . I do n't like them . I have small feet and it looks like I have clown feet with these sneakers . The stitching is poorly done . Did I mention that it took forever to get them ? I am going to return them .Update I returned them and I had to followup on my own with Amazon 's help to find out if they received the return . Shoes .com never contacted me . I was not pleased with shoes .com from the beginning of this order to the very end . Thanks very much , Amazon . You are the best .	0

Yes , I do love it . Four functions all in one . It 's slick ! The only negative is its weight while in hand and that seems a bit picky when you have all the rest . Comes with back up batteries . My , my , my . Life can be good .	1
Do n't think just buy it . I love this charger . I have many different batteries I charge . From sanyo eneloop to tenergy to Panasonics . You can even charge lithiums with standard batteries with no problems . You do n't have to worry about over charging them either . Simply slide the tab back until the battery fits in and that 's it . I charge AA AAA 14500 18650 and cr123 equivalents all with no hassle or any problems . Great charger .	1
Great experience at this dealership , got a great discount and they made the whole thing simple and every one was a pleasure to work with . I have love the new car as well !	1
I really was skeptical when I first ordered the product because there are so many things out there that just DON'T do what they say ! Needless to say , I read all of the great reviews and decided to give it a go .BOY am I glad I did ! ! It 's absolutely like a miracle powder . The IBS symptoms are completely relieved ! I have n't felt this good in a LONG time ! The mixture itself is fantastic ! It 's absolutely TASTELESS . No grit . Nothing ! I throw it in my mixer the kind with the wire ball and shake it with just water . yes water and it tastes like nothing ! ! This has made my system more regular , MUCH more comfortable and it 's just fabulous ! I ca n't tell you how pleased I am to have come across it .You MUST try it . If you are serious about your digestion and have had problems in the past . Heather 's Tummy Fiber is a life saver for us ! ! Highly Recommend !	1
Magnetic latch closes on the back which is ok but weird , the tray you stick the phone in is so cheap and cracked when I put my phone in , and I had to use superglue to reconnect the leather to the plastic setting cause it started to peal off within a week .

Wonderful products for such a good deal ! ! The sparkles do fall off one by one , but that 's to be expected because they are exposed and have no extra coating . If you really get that upset by it put some clear nail polish on it , does the same thing . Or super glue ! !	1
Always a great experience . Staff is always very attentive , fast and efficient . A big reason why my next car will also be a Mercedes from Calabasas .	1
07 03 2017 Was contacted by the used car manager . He definitely wanted me to improve my rating of their dealership , but I ca n't . Three more trips to Fuccillo . No follow up by management . After they kept the car for a day and a half , scratches still not buffed out . Touch up looks like a kindergarten student completed the task , actually looks worse . I could have done better myself . Leather tear still noticable . After all this , I gave them a chance to get me back in , and they did not get back in touch with me by the time they said they would . Plastic mirror piece was repaired , only positive thing I can say . I guess if I have any mechanical complications in the next month , and I 'm stupid enough to bring it back to them , I should probably hire a lawyer to bring the car in . Total disappointment . I test drove a used 2014 car on April 30 and decided to purchase it . My salesman AE said they would not budge on the price , but agreed to have a broken piece of plastic around one of the exterior mirrors replaced and some minor scratches buffed out before I left with the car . He also agreed to order touch up paint to repair small chips and deeper scratches and ensure the repairs were completed once the paint arrived . He said it would be a few days . I spent the better part of the weekend at the dealership waiting for the paperwork to be completed and the car to be detailed . When we went outside to inspect the car , the mirror was not fixed . He explained that they do n't carry that part , and besides , it 's was a used car and I got a good deal on it . The scratches that were supposed to be buffed out were not . He put the license plates and the screwdriver on the passenger seat and drove to the service department to have the scratches buffed out . He came back shortly after and said there was n't anyone who could do the work , so he had tried . It was then that I noticed a tear in the leather passenger seat that had not been there previously . He said that the service department must have put it there . I told him I wanted that repaired , too . He said he did n't know what they could do , but he 'd speak with the service manager . I also did not get the second smart key I was expecting , because apparently when people trade in cars they do n't bring both . I was in contact with AE several times and was told the paint still was not there . Finally , when I called on Friday , June 2 , he said it was in and he would call the following week to arrange to have the repairs completed . When he did not contact me , I stopped in on Wednesday , June 7th and spoke with a manager who told me they would not repair the mirror or seat , that AE never should have agreed to that in the first place , but assured me he would speak with AE and they would call the following Monday and get me all set up for a one on one with a detailer to ensure the chips and scratches were fixed to my satisfaction . When no one called , I called AE on Tuesday morning . He said he 'd call me at 730pm to confirm a Saturday morning appointment . He did not call and my calls go to voicemail . NO ONE IS HELPING ME WITH THIS SIMPLE ISSUE . THIS DEALERSHIP HAS TAKEN ALL THE JOY OUT OF PURCHASING A NEWER CAR . I ALSO HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THE EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY . THIS WORRIES ME BECAUSE THE FINANCE MANAGER DID NOT LET ME TAKE A COPY OF THE GLOSSY BROCHURE HE SHOWED ME , SINCE I'D BE RECEIVING ONE WITH THE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL . HOPE IT 'S NOT THE OLD BAIT AND SWITCH .	0
Used car salesman called back saying they accept the price I quoted , when I went to buy they again quoted a 1000 more . DONOT MAKE ANY ADVANCE PAYMENT OVER PHONE . Then the new car salesman begged me to come in so that they could match the price from a different dealer , they ended up quoting more and talking rude when I questioned why they have begged me to come in the first place if they ca nt match the price which I have already mentioned .	0

every other movie web site i visit has the ability to set the city or the zipcode , then choose the radius for the search , so you can specify how many miles away theaters can be to be included in your search . vital for small towns like ours when you want to search out to 30 miles or 40 miles . . . . i have no idea what your default search radius is , but it 's not enough , and i have to perform multiple searches to get all the theaters into my search . very surprised that such a prominent site as fandango is missing such a basic feature .	0
Never again . I have been taking my 2002 Triumph Bonneville to Motoprimo off and on for years for typical service . Nothing major as the bike preforms great , even at 15 years old . Just tires , brakes , chains , etc . Last summer I needed a new front tire . Brought it in . waited three weeks and did n't hear anything back . Got conflicting reports that they either lost it or forgot to order it all together . Fine . Finally got the tire on . Went to pick it up , paid for the service and went outside to get my bike . sitting on the seat was a plastic baggy containing two , broken off hex bolt heads . they were the heads of the bolts securing the axle to the forks on one side of the bike . Asked why no one had mentioned to me that this happened ? they could not give me a good reason . They said they would fix it , but not for free and it would likely cost more than I paid for the tire to get those broken bolts out . The axle was still secure , so I decided to take the bike home and fix it myself . As I was pulling away , the front fender fell back out of its mounts onto the new front tire . Upon inspection , the remaining 2 hex screws that held the fender mount on were not even completely hand tightened . it appears that the tech . threaded each screw a couple turns to hold the fender in place and then walked away . I took the fender completely off , and road home with it in my lap . Completely disgusted with the service offered by the Dealer , which is a shame , as I have had nothing but good luck with their parts department when I have ordered parts for myself in the past . I will not be going back .	0

I 'm going to give it a few more tries but in a few trials at my GP 's office this thing is 2030 points higher on the systolic and 10 points higher on the diastolic vs . the oldschool measurements . The auto inflate feature is great , the memory and ability to download and print is great , and my GP says Omron is generally good stuff .I was told by a PA that the technique of taking three readings in a row and then averaging them something this machine does automatically and brags about in the manual is something she was told NOT to do in school . . .that is , taking multiple readings within a short period of time on the same arm . Her reasoning was that the cuff compresses the blood vessels and if you keep taking readings from the same arm close to each other , the 2nd and 3rd readings are suspect .If the batteries fall out as mine did in my suitcase on a road trip , remember to reset the date and time . I 'd assume that would be good advice after changing batteries .Update August 2010 I am shopping for a new monitor . This unit consistently overstates both systolic and diastolic , and the amount of overstatement is very sporadic so for example , I ca n't subtract N from the readings to come up with a reasonable estimate . As another reviewer pointed out , sometimes the results are so high that they will scare you . Given the number of positive reviews I suspect this is a sample defect , not a design problem , but I need something more reliable .	0

Management and Financial Leadership continue to mislead consumers . The bar has been lowered significantly regarding standards and customer satisfaction . This dealership financial leadership knowingly deceive me by offering me a 2 , 500 plus interest service package in which they did not honor and fail to disclose there was an expiration date in which to utilize the services . When confronted , I was told unfortunately we have received numerous complaints and as a result we have new financial management . It is however unfortunate for me who is left without resolution . Mercedes Benz of Buckhead are not worthy of the J . D . Power plagued and brand on their walls . In fact , they should remove the false representation immediately . I will never purchase anything from this location again nor recommend them in the future . It 's time for new leadership with respect and integrity for consumers who deserve honesty .	0

This neat little trimmer has been available for years in Japan , and has now come to the United States . It is a battery operated trimmer one AA battery , which is included ! , and is designed to fit comfortably in the hand . The shaving head itself is well designed , and has never given me even the smallest of cuts .The small size of the head makes it ideal for trimming eyebrows and the bikini area , and even allows for detailed trimming , for when you want to get creative in your trimming . Now , this is a trimmer and not a shaver , so chances are that you will want to follow up with your regular shaver to get rid of any residual stubble .I love my Femini where did they get that name , though ? , and use it all the time . I highly recommend this trimmer .Review of Seiko SYard PS335 Shavy Femini TShape Personal Trimmer	1

After I bought my car , he even assisted me in dropping of my rental car . Excellent service and I am happy with my purchase !	1
Update Canceled ServiceI ca n't find my 5 Star Responder device anywhere . If it is still here in the house , I can not find it . And their device locater does n't work it appears . And if they ca n't find the location of the device , then it ca n't find me either . Cost over 140 for the device , setup and barely over two months service and I was n't even in the country for three weeks . Customer service put me on hold forever and I finally hung up . They did n't even bother to call me back . Next thing I got was an email saying I was disconnected from their service . Their solution was for me to buy another device . It they ca n't locate my first device , why would I want to buy a second one ? Second UpdateI finally found it in my upper kitchen cabinet drawer where it blended in with something else . So if it could not find this device in my kitchen , how could I ever depend upon it in an emergency ? I will never ever consider this device again in my life .Original ReviewThis is a compact urgent response device that you can keep strapped to your belt or keychain . It has adapters for each way . The manual leaves you with conflicting uses for this device . They make a point it is NOT to be used for critical emergencies such as heart attack , stroke or fire . I think this part must have been written by their corporate lawyer . I learned this after I had already spent 29 .58 25 plus 4 .58 of taxes to sign up via the internet . That was after their internet signup 10 discount rather exorbitant taxes . Then with tax on the 15 monthly service fee , it cost me over 20 the first month . They seem to promote emergencies of inconvenience versus medical emergencies . I bought it for emergency medical purposes .They collect all kinds of information during the internet signup that took me two hours to complete . They say it only takes 20 minutes , but that would be for someone with no medication and no doctors and no relatives . After I finished the very detailed information data entry , I will say they should be well prepared if I should ever need assistance .To test it is generally a oneway test . You enter a test call via the internet not this device and wait for them to call you with an automated dialer saying your device is configured correctly . And then it said I was located in a city ten miles away . Well , that is n't exactly narrowing down to anything useful . I hope in a real situation it pinpoints my location exactly . Otherwise , I could have saved a lot of money and depended upon my cell phone which displays GPS coordinates for free .	0

The sheets are not very good quality , and they have sticky tabs on them that are to be pulled . . . .one before installation and one after installation . They left a sticky film where they were and the film can not be removed easily . I have been wiping the top right corner area for days now and the nasty film is still there and now it 's getting a little darker due to use . If you do n't mind the film being a little scratched all over and the sticky residue that it leaves behind , you will be fine with this cheaper protector , but I will pay for the more expensive ones in the future . It 's also hard to get all the bubbles out of these too . These are not good quality screen protectors . You get what you pay for .	0

Early this year , Polysporin was recommended by a dermatologist after I had a biopsy taken , to prevent an infection .Just yesterday , a very small scratch on my hand came in contact with raw poultry . Even though I washed it many times with soap and water , within hours the cut started to show signs of infection it turned bright red , it was no longer a thin pink scratch , but was now an area a little larger than a dime , and was getting swollen .First I tried washing it with soap and water . No luck . Then , salt water solution . No luck . Tried rubbing alcohol . No luck . It was starting to look worse like it was getting larger . Reluctantly , I knew I had to use some sort of medicine although I try to use as little as humanly possible . Within 30 minutes of rewashing the wound with soap , applying the Polysporin ointment with a sterile gauze and tape , the area changed from bright red to light pink . Within a few hours , there was barely any pinkness left . By morning , you could only see the line of the scratch , but no sign of swelling , redness , no pink color it looks good .It seems a good idea to keep changing the dressing twice a day , as my derm doc had me do for that biopsy site washing the area with soap and water , drying it with a clean / sterile gauze , and then reapply the polysporin covered with sterile gauze and tape to make sure it finishes healing , of course .All in all , I think this Polysporin saved me a trip to the doc on Monday . Thank goodness for that ! Highly recommended . Just make sure you do n't use it for longer than a week unless your physician tells you to . The med is fairly powerful and not for long term use . It is never to be used internally , but is only approved for external use .POLYSPORINActive Ingredients Each grams contains Bacitracin Zinc 500 units , Polymyxin B Sulfate 10 , 000 unitsCompare with NEOSPORINActive Ingredients Each gram contains Polymyxin B Sulfate 5 , 000 units , Bacitracin Zinc 400 units , Neomycin 3 .5 mgNote that this Polysporin is a double antibiotic and contains MORE units of Bacitracin Zinc and Polymyxin B Sulfate than Neosporin ointment does . My dermatologist told me not to use the Triple Antibiotic Neosporin because the third antibiotic in Neosporin , Neomycin , is a common allergin for many people . Although anyone can be allergic to anything at all her recommendation was not to tempt fate by using a product with Neomycin at all especially since I tend to be allergic to almost everything .Hope this helps you .	1

This bracelet arrived broken in its plastic sleeve . The metal piece that is inserted into the crystal bead was pulled out and did not go back in . The bracelet came stapled to a cardstock backer , and that may have been the issue perhaps it was stapled with too much tension on the chain . I began to wonder if it came already broken that if it had come whole , how long would it stay that way ? The crystal beads were very pretty though and the crystals were well lined up to be visually appealing , showing some nice workmanship .

definitely the best underwear I have ever owned . I have tried soooooo many different styles and pairs . I have been hunting for the perfect fit , comfortable waist , something that does n't ride up the back or the crotch , gives adequate cup support and is ventilated . This might be the miracle undergarment . Plus , they actually do dry quickly . I travel light and have actually washed them in the sink . By morning . . . . clean and dry ! These have replaced my everyday wear . I do n't wear these to the gym , as I prefer something with even more cup support , but for a light workout , these would be great .	1

It is hard to beat this deal . Three protectors for a fantastic price . It is so easy to install and fits exactly . Ca n't even tell there is a protector on the screen .

I got this for my son 15 years old for Christmas . I took a chance because I did n't really know if he would like it or not . He said he really likes it because it shaves him without breaking his face out . He was on accutane for six months so that 's a big deal to him . Great quality and it 's still going strong .	1

I have no earthly idea how this product got any good reviews . Either everybody gets a different one , or the high reviews are people who never owned a quality screen protector . This item is a waste of bandwidth just to advertise it .1 . Optically faulty Has wavy lines ALL OVER THE FACE , even the cheapo Walmart junk is clearer than this2 . Comes with its own built in dust I applied this as I have my other protectors for over 5 years , including wearing gloves and using compressed air , this thing either comes with built in dust or it 's an amazing duster3 . Too thin I doubt this can protect my phone from a heavy wind4 . Squeegee is a joke flimsy as a playing card and about as useful in pushing bubbles5 . Cloth is a square piece of something resembling fabric , but it 's not microfiber , and all it does is smear the glass6 . I see why it 's a 5 pack . You use 4 to figure out it 's junk , and you use 1 to put something on your phone until you buy a real screen protectorI gave it a 1 star rating because 100 is not an option . Worst purchase of this type of product I 've ever made .Amazon has become a flea market for China wholesale . I 'm sick of it , and I 'm sick of giving them the benefit of the doubt .	0

I have been using TOBS Jermyn Street Sensitive Skin shave cream . I really love the shave I get with that , but I decided to try this just as something different . As much as I love the TOBS , I 'd have to say this gave me a better shave . The TOBS smell is much much better . It has a very manly smell , whereas this is more neutral . The coconut smell is very mild . The lather is just as good as any other cream I 've tried , but it 's very thick and creamy . I noticed a difference right away my first time using this and when I was done , I did my usual acrossthegrain pass and the difference was even more noticeable . The razor just glides across my skin like nothing . It 's an amazing product that gave me an even better shave than I thought was possible . The TOBS produces a great shave and smells amazing , but the quality of this shave was better . When I finished , my skin was smoother and seemed more hydrated .Overall , I would recommend this product with no reservation . The smell is n't my favorite , pleasant , but not my favorite , but the quality of the shave I am getting far outweighs any minor smell issues .	1

Hennessy Cadillac Duluth GAI went to Hennessy Cadillac with my mother who needed service on her Cadillac . She had previously taken her car to an Athens dealership but received subpar customer service . I located Hennessy on the internet and suggested we try them out . I went with her based on the poor treatment she had received at other dealership but it was not necessary because Shannon and Courtney treated her like a queen ! They were professional , helpful , respectful and took care of her issue quickly . The price was in line for the problem . I will recommend them to anyone with a Cadillac . Thank you Shannon and Courtney for knowing the real meaning of customer service .	0

Bought the older version of this case , priced at approx . 7 .00 and they sent me the 30 .00 one for no adtl charges . I read the reviews and apparently the version I bought does nt have a cut out for the second mic on the back of the phone and the cut out to the buttom for the charger did nt fit right . Ppl said that you could not have the case on and charge it at the same time .Read reviews for the 30 case and it was all imporved to perfection .Came in the mail , put it on , and low and behold , I got the upgraded phone case for no Charge at all ! THANK YOU guys for having such high Integrity ! Highly recommend this compny . Great products , Fast Shipping , Very Honest !	1
I honestly do n't really care that it did n't work since I was just looking for a way to charge my tablet anyway and the cord that came with it works fine , but I think you should be aware if you are buying this for what it actually says its supposed to do . I plugged it in right out of the box and the light did n't light up nor did the tablet charge or anything . Sometimes we use it as a stand to watch Netflix on it but since it does n't work it is literally just a stand , not an actual dock .	0

I had a rim repair contract that would expire on 8 / 31 / 2017 . I took my Q7 to the dealership and talked to Michael on 8 / 20 . There was no loaner cars available and he suggested that I get back in a few days . And then Hurricane Harvey came . . . To help me beat the deadline , they wrote the ticket on 8 / 31 and allowed me extra couple of weeks to bring my car back there . It was truly a great customer service !

I 've happily used this product in the past much easier than a Neti Pot or the nasal irrigation syringe I use however this time the packaging really presented problems . When I first used it the tab stayed compressed after I released it and saline continued spraying . I 'm not sure what happened , but after about a week since its arrival after only a few uses , it 's all evaporated . Perhaps the tab stayed compressed a little and I did n't realize it . I 'm especially upset because I 've used this product in the past and had no issues and because I paid more for the giant size .	0

the whole point in me buying advance tickets is so i do n't have to stand in line when i get to the movie theater but most of the theaters in my area still have you stand in the one line that they have open to exchange your online slip purchase for tickets to get into the theater . can there be an upgrade process so that what you print at home is able to be used to just walk in when you get to the theater ?	0

This gadget is great for everyday use . I wear it constantly to track step and miles and noticed I walk much longer and further as a result . The software is also very intuitive and can be installed on both Android and Iphones that syncs with fitbit one seamlessly . Water / sweat resistant makes this a great tool for outside runs but , it is not waterproof . I washed mine by mistake and it never came back on . The customer service is excellent as I informed the manufacturer and they replaced no questions asked as long I a can produce a receipt for the product for less than a year from purchase date glad I ordered from Amazon . I would highly recommend this product for anyone who want to add some pep in their step .	1

I 've been using Glide ProHealth Deep Clean Floss in Cool Mint for years now and accidentally ran out last week . So we searched around and found some other Colgate floss and some generic floss from the Dentist to use until we could get more Glide Floss . The result was not pretty . The other floss cut into my gums and got stuck between teeth and shredded like crazy . It was just a very unpleasant experience . Plus the other floss was uncomfortable to hold . Glide floss is like a miracle in comparison . I also like the blast of mint each time you floss . This is the best floss I 've ever used .The Rebecca Review	1

I have use the Speck phone case since purchasing the first iPhone 4 . All the while using the phone with this case , I have dropped it from over 4 feet in height onto concrete with no damage what so ever . I have to point out that I use a Zagg protective screen cover , which I feel is a mandatory accessory . Regardless , Speck cases will protect your phone , no matter what the make or model of the phone . I just received my case for the newest Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone , and it is the same protective quality one expects from the Speck company . Remember , the longer a phone has been released , the more options and types of cases will become available .Since the Note 3 just came out , there is only one model case , but it has 3 color combos from which to choose .Thank you	1
I 've been using my Oral B toothbrush for , goodness , eight years now , and I love it . These brush heads are my favorite . While some of the other brush heads available have fancy features like gum massaging or floss action , I have found that I do n't want a gum massage and I can floss just fine on my own . I want a straightforward and effective toothbrush head , and I 've settled on these as they are functional and effective without having too many bells and whistles to where it ruins the experience . I brush twice a day for the two minutes signaled by the toothbrush , and my heads last about two months before they look ready to be replaced .	1

This dealership is 45 minutes from my house so I called prior to leaving to confirm the used car was still on the lot and to explain that I would n't arrive until approximately 20 minutes prior to closing to make sure this would be ok . I spoke with Chad who confirmed the car was on the lot and said it was perfectly fine to show up that late and he would have a salesperson ready to work with me when I arrived and I could stay as late as I needed . I was greeted by Chad and the salesperson Javier Gonzalez shortly after arriving and Javier was already familiar with the car so we were able to start the process right away . Javier took the car through the dealership 's onsite car wash and then I inspected the car internally and externally very clean and prepped . The test drive was easy and I thoroughly enjoyed my interaction with Javier during the test drive both from his knowledge base of the car and his personality and sales style . He worked with me well beyond his scheduled working hours never making me feel the least bit troubled or rushed for doing so . I returned with my wife the next day and completed the purchase . I cringe when thinking about the process of buying a car but this was the most pleasant and painless experience I 've had . From my initial call with Chad my exceptional sales experience with Javier to the closing with Carl , the process was efficient and pleasant . I will definitely encourage folks I know in the market for a car to visit this dealership and I would highly , and without hesitation , recommend working with Javier . Kudos !	1

I have used the Moom sugar kits which I think are very good and I thought I would try their prewaxed strips kit . Sadly , they are not effective . I think I would say they got maybe 15 . But worse than the poor performance , these strips leave a very sticky residue on your skin . The only good thing in this kit is the tiny bottle of pleasant oil . I will stick to their sugar kits which are a little more work to prep and use plus it washes off and does n't leave a sticky residue .	0

i dropped my car off here a few weeks ago for warranty work and had a terrible experience . I was told that because a new turbo is needed it would n't be fixed for about a week . When I asked for a loaner they told me none were available , which could be understandable . However if you are going to have my vehicle for over a week and not accommodate me with another I find this to be unacceptable . Mike , the service manager , told me I can either pick my car up and drive it around or take it somewhere else . This dealership has shown no urgency or interest in providing its customers with the services that they have paid for . Last but not least the manner in which my vehicle was returned was nothing short of disrespectful . My car was left half way hanging out of my parking lot , and due to a recently broken foot I was not able to move it myself . When I go to inspect my car I notice my running boards are halfway knocked off on both sides . Worst customer experience ever with this place and I will never go back again ! !	0

I test drove a used 2014 car on April 30 and decided to purchase it . My salesman AE said they would not budge on the price , but agreed to have a broken piece of plastic around one of the exterior mirrors replaced and some minor scratches buffed out before I left with the car . He also agreed to order touch up paint to repair small chips and deeper scratches and ensure the repairs were completed once the paint arrived . He said it would be a few days . I spent the better part of the weekend at the dealership waiting for the paperwork to be completed and the car to be detailed . When we went outside to inspect the car , the mirror was not fixed . He explained that they do n't carry that part , and besides , it 's was a used car and I got a good deal on it . The scratches that were supposed to be buffed out were not . He put the license plates and the screwdriver on the passenger seat and drove to the service department to have the scratches buffed out . He came back shortly after and said there was n't anyone who could do the work , so he had tried . It was then that I noticed a tear in the leather passenger seat that had not been there previously . He said that the service department must have put it there . I told him I wanted that repaired , too . He said he did n't know what they could do , but he 'd speak with the service manager . I also did not get the second smart key I was expecting , because apparently when people trade in cars they do n't bring both . I was in contact with AE several times and was told the paint still was not there . Finally , when I called on Friday , June 2 , he said it was in and he would call me the following week to arrange to have the repairs completed . When he did not contact me , I stopped in on Wednesday , June 7th and spoke with a manager who told me they would not repair the mirror or seat , that AE never should have agreed to that in the first place , but assured me he would speak with AE and they would call the following Monday and get me all set up for a one on one with a detailer to ensure the chips and scratches were fixed to my satisfaction . When no one called , I called AE on Tuesday morning . He said he 'd call me at 730pm to confirm a Saturday morning appointment . He did not call and my calls go to voicemail . NO ONE IS HELPING ME WITH THIS SIMPLE ISSUE . THIS DEALERSHIP HAS TAKEN ALL THE JOY OUT OF PURCHASING A NEWER CAR . I ALSO HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THE EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY . THIS WORRIES ME BECAUSE THE FINANCE MANAGER DID NOT LET ME TAKE A COPY OF THE GLOSSY BROCHURE HE SHOWED ME , SINCE I'D BE RECEIVING ONE WITH THE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL . HOPE IT 'S NOT THE OLD BAIT AND SWITCH .	0

Sadly in this case , if you buy a battery for 15 of what it normally sells for you get 15 of a battery . After just a few days it wo nt charge all the way , I think the voltage must be inconsistent coming out of these these things causing strange behavior in my phone . They appear to be genuine , but they must be rejects for some reason . Save your 5 bucks , its better spent on a sandwich than this battery .	0

This shaver IS NOT RECHARGEABLE ! ! ! I never saw that clearly in the descriptionthat you have to keep putting AA batteries in . I mean , who wants to keep doing that all the time ? I guess I 'm just either a good reader or just totally naive . NOT RECHARGEABLE and BATTERIES NEEDED should be prominent in the description . Thankful this was a Prime order and I could send it back .	0

The salesman Michael is amazing . This review is not because we did not get the offer that we were expecting , but because the finance team and mainly the way that Kenneth Kim reacted when we were not ready to make the deal . He mentioned as soon as he came to us that what s going on ? why are nt you taking this amazing deal ? He mentioned , I should nt be dropping the price on this car the way I did . Well if you should nt be doing it then DONT do it . Do nt tell us that you are doing us a favor . We are buying a car and there is nothing as such a favor about this . He was making us feel humiliated . When we told him what our budget was he straight said that we should not be wasting any time . Instead he could have asked us about what he can do to do anything better . But no he was very blunt . Not only that I HAD to reach out to him to shake his hand when we were leaving . He had a posture that said Get out of hereOn another note they took my credit card for a security deposit and never returned the card . I had to ask for it is when that happened . I am sorry but they are very unprofessional . I am sure you are going to ask me to email you my concern and all of that but I am not going to do that . When you lease a car your payments should be much lower . You should nt be paying almost 36000 dollars already into the lease when the car is only 56000 . I am COMMITTED to buy it at the end of lease as i have invested so much into it . I would proudly like to let you know that I got an Audi for myself that I am very proud of . You will not see me enter the dealership ever again . Mind you I have bought over 7 cars next door with DarCars so it is a shame .	0
If you have the Hyperion extended battery and door for your Note 2 , this is the only case that fits correctly and well . And a nice bonus is the kickstand ! ! You can spend more on silly cases , but this one gives the phone a touch of class and feels right on your hands when you are holding it . All ports are easily accessible too and I like the color choices as well .	1

The cover showed up on time and was very easy to install on my phone . I only use the belt clip when I 'm cutting grass so I can use my ear buds . I usually put my phone in my pocket . The rubber cover has a lot of grip so it wo n't slip out of your hand or work it 's way out of your pocket or slide around in the car . The protective screen is great but will scratch easily so I left my screen protector on too and the sensitivity works fine . My friend scratched her 's in her purse . I know at least 5 people who have the otterbox and are very pleased . It 's cover is very strong and will not crack , or at least has n't yet . Update 6 / 18 / 12 I stopped using this because of a couple of reasons , 1 it is so sticky it pulled my pocket inside out . 2 the rubber over time looses it 's shape and wants to come loose . I have several friends that still use theirs .	1
This product , in and of itself , is fine . Getting it from Amazon is costeffective and convenient . However , I recently switched to the reusable Diva Cup there are lots of different options out there , and while there was a learning curve , I wish I had done it a long time ago . It 's no more gross than disposable tampons , and now I do n't have to waste 15 every month on disposables , not to mention not having to worry about where to dispose of a tampon if I 'm at a friend 's house or somewhere without a trash can or camping or whatever . It 's not for everybody , but I wish I had known about it sooner .	0

i do not like the new format ! it requires me to log in and asks for personal information , yet it is less personal , almost useless , and consists mostly of ads . i do n't see how to add movies to my movies i want to see , it 's not convenient to have my theatres in the new single file format , and the missing ' new profile views ' counter was the only one i considered useful . the site is no longer useful in looking for movies to see and has discouraged me from going to movies until i can come up with an alternative .	0

Previously ordered a variety of Think Thin bars and never considered complaining about anything . However , received these for the first time , and ate half of one before a rather chewy , dry texture , and chemical taste alerted me to not eat more . Very strange for Think Thin so I tossed the remaining half and drank some water and forgot about it . Half an hour later the muscles in my calves started to ache and then my joints felt like I was getting sick with something . I can describe it now as similar to an inflammatory reaction . Its a mystery .	0

ADDENDUM JUNE 18 , 2014 I had to drop this from 5 stars to 1 star . Well , something must have happened since the last ios update , because this lightning charger is no longer supported by Apple . It was never certified , but it used to work , anyway . But I get a message now that comes up on my iPhone This device may not be supported by Apple , and then it stops charging it . I know that some of the offbrands never worked . Well , Zeetron did , for months . But , since I last updated , this is having a problem . This is not Applecertified , which means it will not work correctly . Also , the phone started to heat up , to where it was almost too hot to handle .So , sorry to Zeetron , this is something Apple has done , somehow encoding , which tells the device nogo . But , it makes this device not hospitable , unless you are happy turning it off to charge . Yes , it DOES charge if you turn off your device completely , but after the hottemperature incident , I would n't trust it . It could damage your Apple device .Bottom line Do n't buy any lightning charger that does n't say Applecertified .Below is my initial review , before this nonsupport message popped up recently .ORIGINAL REVIEW MAY 23 , 2014 I received this product for review with the warning that it might not fit with bulky cases . Well , it sure works on my iPhone 5 Otterbox Defender , and it does n't get bulkier than that . It also works on my iPad 4th gen , which is fitted into a bulkyBolkin . The cord is a little over 3 feet long and sufficiently sturdy .When it is charging , the red light appears . When it is 100 charged , the blue light comes on . That 's the most innovative bell or whistle to come along and improve the lightning charger .	0

I requested to see the 2008 Chevy Impala LT , that I had called about the night before and was told that it was still available . When the used car salesman went to get the key for it the manager informed him that a deposit had been placed on it so it was no longer available . I asked to look at the 2008 Dodge Avenger , which was burgundy in the pucture it turned out to be white , and the front passenger window failed to roll down . A majority of the cars had the appearance of the Car Cemetery , some were stained and dirty on the inside . Some vehicles needed paint jobs , others had dents . The used car salesman stated that these were sold As is . I saw newer model vehicles which did n't appeal to me , so I left .	0

Nice fit and good looking pant to wear daily or on the golf course .

I originally purchased the LF series of this case and found the shiny surface too slipper for my taste . It was always slipping around my hand and I was worried I 'd drop it . I had a CaseMate Barely There for my older iPhone 4 and was looking for something with a similar texture .I decided to order the SF and I 'm glad I did . It has the coverage and protection I was looking for in a sturdy , thin design . The texture of the case is not slippery , it has a slight rubbery feel to it that aids in holding the phone . It 's not so ' sticky ' that it causes problems keeping your phone in your pocket . I feel comfortable holding the phone and do n't worry about it slipping out of my hands .The case has good cutouts for the buttons and even has slightly larger cutouts for the power button and lightning cable connector .	1

So I bought this guy to be my travel charger for my android phone and my iPad for when I am doing some serious flying , further than any of my older batteries will last , this guy jumps out of my bag , plugs into and I an watch whatever while he charges away , worked really well on a trip with a 8 hour flight I think , not sure how long but more than 1 phone battery half iPad battery given the fact both units have so e age , nice rig , would certainly recommend .	1

We ordered this for a trip to Europe , within the first week it fell apart at the stitching along the back .

I was very disappointed with this brush . I was hoping with all of the good reviews , this would have been a good purchase . . . .I was wrong . First . . .I was unprepared for how small it would be . I realized , with such a low price , it would likely be smaller than the brush it was replacing . It is considerably smaller than the brush I got from this shaving kit here on Amazon http // www .amazon .com / VanHagenMensLuxuryShave / dp / B004L4EING / refsr11 ? shpcieUTF8qid1354139209sr11keywordsshavingkitThe size is something that I am willing to overlook . . .however , what I was not happy about is that the brush started losing a high number of bristles from day one . I followed the same practices that I was using with my old brush . . .but I felt like I probably lost more bristles out of this brush in the first three weeks than I did in about eight months with my old brush . With all the good reviews for this product , I 'm not sure if I just happened to get a bad , individual brush or what . . .I was so disappointed with it , I went back to my old brush for now .	0
I wear these most of the time , to help with swelling in my feet . I need compression from the nerve damage , and a blot clot I had in my feet . These compression sleeves help pump the blood back up and keep it moving . I love these sleeves more then the stockings because they are alot easier to put on . Also regular stockings were digging into my feet because they were so swelled up that it created a little scab / scar .If you thought about getting stockings to help with swelling or relief some pain , do n't Get these leg sleeves instead and you will be very pleased . These are the top quality material , trust me I have had at least five different brands of compression material .Go with Zensah you ca n't go wrong !	1

It looks nothing like this picture . It actually looks much , much cheaper . It does n't stack like this , the leather if that 's what it is is quite flimsy . The worst part , however , is that with the one I received , the strands were not cut precisely . About 3 strands appeared shredded , as if they went over the cut again . It just looked awful and definitely not wearable . So disappointed .	0

This case does not even come close to fitting the Galaxy S4 . It is way too big . It might fit if you had the larger batter backing on the phone .

I 'm normally a big fan of Anker devices , but this charger did not work , and fried my cellular modem when I plugged it into the attached cord . The voltages , etc matched but when the modem was plugged in , the light on the charger started blinking erratically . I unplugged things within about 15 seconds but since then , my modem wo n't actually turn off I have to pull the battery to get it to turn off . That 's a big bummer , as it makes it hard to charge . I 'd hesitate before buying another Anker product .That said , the idea behind this device is excellent enough juice for a phone and a tablet , with one built in cord and one port for external devices , whether they are Apple OR another type of device .	0

I have used Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse for many years and loved the product . It was always gentle and effective . Imagine my surprise when I tried my most recent purchase and it caused my mouth to burn so badly that I had to rinse it out . There was also a strong minty smell that was not there before . I bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same . I am deeply saddened that I can not use this product any more and wonder what I will do . Also I am miffed that I paid big bucks for two bottles of Biotene that I ca n't use .Why would a company make a horrible change like this . It is new product development gone horribly awry . People with dry mouth also often have a very sensitive mouth . DUH . Lets make a product that our customer base ca n't use .I noticed the the company posted a response to one of the amazon reviews saying call us and let us know about your problem . I called twice today and after waiting over ten minutes each time gave up . I then sent two emails , neither of which have been answered . So much for their caring and great customer service .Update Since I had to stop using the reformulated Biotene Mouthwash because it caused terrible burning I have developed serious problems in my mouth . Five years of using Biotene with great success and now I am in trouble . Set adrift without notice to try and find another product that might work . How can a company ignore its loyal customers , people who depend on them , and reformualte so drastically a product that worked so well for so many people for so many years . When I finally got through to customer service , after many minutes of waiting on many tries , their answer was basically tough luck . Do n't support a company that would do this . There are other products out there , or at least I hope so .	0

What a godawful long wait for a simple oil change and the check on fluids . There was only three other cars ahead of me but it has taken two and a half hours for an oil change . I would not recommend anyone buy a vehicle from here or have any real business with this place unless it 's a commercial account because they seem to respond better to those accounts more than their customers which does n't make sense because as an auto salesman you want customers to come back for another one but I can admit I will never come back here for nothing more than an oil change which I pay for any way through the USA Plan	0
I had tried this style already and had returned them , but with the sale price . . . I was seduced into buying this style again .

I am 50years old with a normal skin type . Finding Lipoic acid , DMAE , CEster and CoQ10 in one affordable face product seemed like a dream come true and I eagerly awaited receipt of this product .I was quite surprised upon opening the jar to see what looked like a rather heavy product . . .like a paste or peanut butter . But you never know until you try it , right ? So I went ahead and used it .The scent seemed to me like a tanning lotion . . .not coconut but like many tanning lotion scents I 'm familiar with from my tanning bed days . Fortunately the scent either fades quickly or I just got used to it fast because I could n't notice it about half hour later .Well I went on about my business for a few hours or so and when I returned to the bathroom I looked in the mirror and noticed my pores look very large ! 45 hours later I noticed I was beginning to break out .Based on my own experience with this one use , I would NOT recommend this product .	0
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE , DISHONEST , AND THIEVES ! ! ! STAY AWAY FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ! ! ! Probably one of the worst I 've been to . I am very patient and understanding , but boy does this place test you . First off , I came into the service department to figure out why my car cigar lighter socket was n't working thinking it was a burned out fuse , but because we were not in the area evacuating from hurricane IRMA we thought it best to go to a jeep dealership . They invited me in and sat me down in the waiting area . Sitting there for 30 minutes without attention . Afterwards they told me it would take an hour to review the issue . I was fine with waiting . The wait ended up being 4 hours long without progress . Finally they get the car in having me wait another hour before completing the work . I had to remind them several times to follow up on the work . NO ONE knew what was going on or how long it would take ! Their customer service is horrible . After getting home I realize that I was missing my 150 sun glasses that I left under the front seat . Eventually I found the case in the trunk shoved between the cracks with no sun glasses . I called the service manager for multiple times in 3 days without a return call . We finally left a message with the director which got the manager named CHRISTY 's attention . She sounded annoyed , dismissive , and tried to deflect the blame back to us . She offered us a 50 credit for their dealership , which we refused to accept because of the lack of courtesy and trust . We would never go back here either way . Please save your money and go somewhere else .	0

I am from out of town and I have been in contact with this dealer for about two weeks negotiating arrangements and price for me to pick up a 2016 Mazda CX9 Grand Touring and value for my tradein . I agreed to price for their vehicle two weeks ago and they wanted to offer me 3200 dollars less for my vehicle then what kbb values it , at trade in value ! I really wanted this vehicle so against my better judgement I said I would meet them halfway . They declined the offer and it took two weeks just to get an offer 1700 dollars under kbb tradein weird because I agreed to this two weeks ago . I agreed and got my own financing , sent them the letter of approval for financing , and found a sitter for my daughter , gave them payment info for a deposit so that nobody could buy the car while I was on the drive there . They asked me to fill out there credit application even though I already had financing , so I did . Then after all this , as I am driving there , they call me and tell me they sold the vehicle to someone else . It Took two weeks to get a less than fair trade in value from them which is one I already agreed to about two weeks prior , but they did n't want to give it to me then ! . . . . Just so they can tell me the vehicle is mine and then sell it from under me as I 'm driving there . Conclusion is that this dealer has a lack of good ethics and very poor communication skills . Very disappointed .	0

This screen protector does n't fit to Samsung Galaxy S4 . It is bit bigger than the screen and even it looks it fits and does n't show any bubbles on the edges , after few hours corner edges get bubbly .Also it is extremely sticky , you have only one chance to put it on , otherwise you need to throw it .I remember I have had always bad experience with Tech Armor , after I get frustrated with the product .	0

I really like Apple products , but the biggest complaint is the Proprietarity think I spelled that right and cost of accessories . For once , a product that works , is cheap , works better than expected , and is cheaper the 2nd time I purchased it , did I mention it works ! I bought 1 about 2 months ago . Have different vehicles I use , and then after my brother borrowing my cradle for GPS purposes , I decided to just give it to him and get 2 more . Kensington Thank YOU ! for making this inexpensive , functional accessory for the iPhone .The only thing that could make it better is if the cradle either A was longer at the base of the phone holder with a curviture toward the driver or B came with a clip on over the phone / case with a curviture toward the driver . Reason being on speaker phone calls , the speaker is on the bottom of the iPhone , if a person holds their hand under the phone the sound travels toward you intstead of down , allowing you to hear a lot better . But that defeats the purpose of handsfree phone calling . If it had this capability I could remove my need for the bluetooth speaker . The cradle I use in the office is designed with this feature and has allowed me to just use speaker phone on iPhone . I do tilt the phone up a bit more than normal to try and compensate for when i do n't have my bluetooth speakerphone , it helps , but is not great .The BlueAnt Speaker Phone I have for the iPhone 4 does n't seem to like connecting and disconnecting after turning the speaker phone off / on upon exiting and reentering the vehicle not the case when I used the Samsung Intensity II . Manual power offs of the Bluetooth in iPhone settings gets old quick .Other than that last bit , again this cradle is perfect , and really love the swivel feature .I can not comment on the feature that allows one to use the air vent . Never had much luck with them even with air freshners , but the arm is fully adjustable and I just love it .	1

I bought this kit for my work desk . I 'm pretty much the goto girl for medical needs , and I do n't count on the receptionist staff to keep the company 's own hard firstaid kit wellstocked . This is kit is inexpensive enough that I do n't mind sharing when something is needed .There are a few things of my own that I added , nothing expensive , but to round out the kit . I share what I added to help anyone out w / setting up their ideal kit , because no matter how good a kit is that you buy , inevitably something is lacking . Everything I added is easily found OTC . I added a packet of Dayquil for allergies colds coming on , a small box of antidiarrheal medicine , 2 Naproxen Sodium pills pain relief , a digital thermometer , a tube of Orajel tooth / gum / mouth pain , a packet of PeptoBismol chewables gas , bloating , acid reflux , etc . , a large waterproof adhesive bandage an Ace wrap .This is the kit I chose to buy for my grandmother , my aunt uncle my best friend , as well that is how helpful great I think that the kit is . For very little money spent , I have piece of mind that people I love will also have a lot of important firstaid pieces which would cost far more if bought separately readily available to them now . You ca n't put a price on peace of mind , knowing that what 's needed in an emergency or even just for a minor cut or burn is readily at hand .Below is a complete listing of what 's in this firstaid kitMedicine , Antiseptics6 Ibuprofen tablets6 Extrastrength nonaspirin tablets6 Aspirin tablets3 Insect sting relief pads6 Antibiotic ointment packs14 Alcohol cleansing pads15 Antiseptic cleansing wipes sting free2 First aid / burn cream packs1 Burn relief packBandages75 Plastic bandages , 3 / 4 x 320 Fabric bandages , 3 / 4 x 330 Plastic bandages , 1 x 310 Fabric bandages , 1 x 32 Elbow knee plastic bandages , 2 x 450 Junior plastic bandages , 3 / 8 x 1 1 / 24 Knuckle fabric bandages4 Fingertip fabric bandages1 Patch bandage , 1 1 / 2 x 1 1 / 2Dressings1 Instant cold compress1 Emergency blanket , 38 x 603 Moleskin squares , 2 x 2 blister prevention3 Butterfly wound closures2 Finger splints , 6 x 3 / 42 First aid tape rolls , 1 / 2 x 5 yd .Injury Treatment1 Trauma pad , 5 x 91 Sterile eye pad6 Gauze dressing pads , 2 x 24 Gauze dressing pads , 3 x 32 Gauze dressing pads , 4 x 41 Conforming gauze roll bandage , 2References , Instruments1 American Medical Association First Aid Guide1 Thermometer , one time use2 Latexfree exam quality vinyl gloves1 Scissors1 Tweezers , plastic10 Cottontipped applicators , 31 Durable clearpocket softpack .	1

I got this a few days ago , and I 've already been using it several times a day . Seven attachments and two speeds equals fourteen different sensations . I use it on back pain in the morning , foot pain when I get home , scalp and face massage to relax before I go to sleep , and , as other reviewers have mentioned , whenever I get my groove on solo . The attachments are PVC , a flexible , rubbery plastic that contains no latex or silicone , so you can use any type of massage oil , lotion , or personal lubricant products you want . They all wash off the attachments easily with regular soap and water . Like many of the other reviewers , I am seriously considering buying another Wahl as a backup , perhaps getting the one with the heated attachment next time . The price is a steal and well worth it . You will find at least one use for this thing .	1

In a crowded market of multiport USB chargers this unit stands out due to the inclusion of an OTG port . This port allows easy hook up of vast array of usb devices to an Android smart phone , tablet or any device that supports an OTG connection . Once the connection is made the USB device can be accessed by the phone or tablet . I have both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 and both units were able to access the data contained on these USB devices perfectly . 1080P movies played perfectly and without stutter . The 4 port charging ports worked well with all my devices . I successfully charged my Nexus 5 , Nexus 7 , Asus Win 8 Tablet , Bluetooth headset and Bluetooth Speaker without issue . The charge time / speed was equal to the speed of the OEM chargers that came with the each respective device .As a side business , I convert wedding / party videos to 1080P MP4 videos that can play on the latest and greatest Android / Apple devices . This unit serves as my test bed for such projects . I do all conversions on my editing PC and then transfer to customers 64 gig flash drive , SD card or USB 2 .5 HDD . Next step , I test final work by simply plugging in the flash / hard drive into the OTG port on this device and the Android Phone or tablet is able to see the data and play without issue . I have tested videos up to 6000 kb / sec 1080P and they played perfectly . The connection has been solid and error free .I would recommend this unit without hesitation to anyone looking for a desktop OTG solution for their Android or any portable device that supports an OTG connection . The extra feature of multi port USB charging is a bonus and can keep all your devices powered up . Kudos to the manufacturer for thinking out of the box and creating a unique product that performs well and is cost effective	1
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s / w worked well to connect .	1

I guess this supplement does n't work well for me . . . The effect I get from it is not a pleasant energetic lift , but a jittery , uncomfortable feeling and mild nausea starting about 30 45 minutes after ingestion and lasting about 2 hours . Since the product contains so little caffeine supposedly 2040 mg , which is over 100 mg less than a standard serving of brewed coffee , more like a small cup of black tea , that alone should n't be an issue . I 've only used it a couple times once early yesterday afternoon when it first arrived in the mail , and once this morning , and I 'll wait a day or two and try it once or twice more , just to be sure , but my initial impression is not good . Maybe my stomach just does n't like it you are instructed to take this on an empty stomach , 30 minutes before eating . Perhaps I need the lower 400 mg dose taken twice or three times per day . Sept 25 2012After much further research , I find that this particular formulation by this manufacturer is NOT pure , and does n't have the recommended ingredients for successful weight loss .	0
I have to say that Audi Santa Monica was absolutely the worst experience I 've had car shopping . So bad in fact that I was willing to pay more money to have the car dealer swapped so I could purchase from a dealership that is at the opposite end of the spectrum , Audi South Coast . Unfortunately , this could n't be arranged and I had to deal with Santa Monica due to the fact that they had a car color that is rare . Santa Monica Audi staff knows next to nothing about the product and merely hopes you are willing to buy whatever stock they have on hand . I also witnessed the famous , what do you want your payments to be ? and yes , we can take your tradein yeah at half of what Carmax or KBB Instant Cash would offer . Requests to view cars will result in dramatic displays of inconvenience . Last minute changes in terms of sale should also be expected . Promises to return calls in 15 minutes result in 2 hour waits if you get a call at all . Requests to speak to managers go unheeded . Ask the staff about what 's included in driveoff and they have no idea . I can only speculate that upper management likes their staff to be stupid so claiming ignorance is n't a complete lie . Oh and nothing is more enjoyable than having someone tell me things like , this is a huge upgrade over your last car and that scratches and dings on a new car are all part of the process . What was the capstone to this whole event ? Walking in on my sales person complaining to his finance guy about how hard he had to work and how much effort he put into this deal . He literally spent less than 15 minutes with me . Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else to buy a car .	0

I did n't have a problem with the appearance of this case . It was actually exactly what I was looking for but , the bumber part of this case was completely detached on one side when I first got it . Tried super gluing it but the super glue kept breaking when I tried to put the case on my phone . Would n't recommend . But it seems that a lot of people like it so maybe I got a bad one ? But I probably wo n't be purchasing cases like this online anymore .	0

I 've used this stylus with three pad devices , including the Kindle Fire . The devices seem much more responsive to the stylus than to my finger , Of course it is narrower than my finger , so that gives me a bit more control with it .I like very much that it clips into the earphone jack . . . makes it very easy to keep track of . It also has a pocket clip on it , which I 've used from time to time .It seems to be sturdy in construction , and since it does n't really have to take any abuse anyway , I expect that it will last indefinitely .About the only thing you ca n't do with it is the pinch gestures for zooming and unzooming . Other than that , it certainly cuts down on the number of fingerprints left on my Fire screen , and I 've found it a huge improvement in play of Plants vs Zombies over just using my finger . LOLHighly recommended .	1

Johan Pistana is very professional , ethical and personable and I would highly recommend that you ask for him when choosing this dealership . His phone is 7865255349 .

I was an early adopter of lifeproof case for my 4S . I originally got it because my son is a competitive swimmer yearround and thought it would be good to have it around a pool . However , one day , after ensuring the seal , I let him borrow it to video while swimming 23 feet underwater and it leaked and damaged my phone . So I looked elsewhere for my 5S and found this case I did look into Nuud , but the reviews were all over the place .I liked the fact that they 've researched and put in a honeycomb structure to absorb shocks I have n't tested the dropping myself to see how well it protects though , the case is simple , but elegant and sleek . Does n't add much bulk like some other cases yet comes with nice cushioned buttons for volume and sleep / wake controls . The icing on the cake is that the price is about the same as those cosmetic cases that do n't offer any protection , so it was a nobrainier to pick this over them . Though the case is not water resistant by any means , the price allowed me to purchase AppleCare so if I ever get my phone damaged by water or a serious drop I 'm covered which I see all the time at swim meets .Fortunately , I do not see any difference in signal reception with or without the case on like some reviewers . As for the headphone plug , it does look somewhat tight and may be an issue for some plugs . However , as an exclusive bluetooth user I have not encountered any issues using Bluetooth accesories while this case is on stereo headsets , speakerphone , car , etc .Oh , and if you need a truly waterproof case , I found an Optrix adventure suit at photojojo that can withstand 15 ft drop and water proof up to 15 ft underwater for just ten bucks more than Lifeproof .	1

Tesla is the only company that takes you seriously , no matter how old you are or what you wear . Several friends of mine startup founders guys and girls who made a swift career at Corporates , already drive a Tesla Model S . Partly for the performance , environmental gains , but also for the experience . I suggest you do some proper soulsearching about how you treat a customer . You managed to not only scare off a potential sale , but tarnished the Porsche brand all the way until the Netherlands . I am seriously interested in the Porsche Mission E and have several friends who would be highly interested hope you do n't drop the ball on this one and timely read up on it , since the promised infrastructure 350kw charging sounds promising and would make Porsche the innovative brand it used to be . . .	0
I 've learned that you do n't necessarily have to buy accessories like chargers and cables from Apple to get good quality , but it took a while to figure that out . In the last year , I 've seen several thirdparty brands that appeared to be of equal quality as Apple accessories . The Pawtec Lightning cable meets or exceeds the quality of other cables that I 've seen and used . The plugs and the section where the cable meets the plug end look to be well made and very durable . The hard rubberlike plug where the Lightning end goes into the iPhone or iPad is 0 .4534 wide , which should fit through most cases . The 3foot length I measured it as 3934 allows enough freedom of motion to move the phone or tablet around , which is essential if you 're in a vehicle with your phone charging from a power port .This is an excellent cable , and it 's considerably less expensive than buying the official Apple cable .A product sample was provided for review purposes .	1
Mine lasted about 5 months before my Thunderbolt started having power problems . Main complaint , phone just turns itself off , usually while you are using it . Complete power failure , Verizon little help but the Verizon forum had enough info from unhappy customers with power problems over the life of the phone that I eventually figured out what was happening .These batteries start to bulge on their large flat sides . Not sure if the battery is the culprit or if the phone somehow heats them up and causes the bulge but never the less , once bulged the batteries move as you push on the phone causing the battery contacts to separate and the phone turns off instantly . You then power it back up and it seems to have plenty of charge . You then are in a nasty loop so the phone looks happy but as soon as you start punching at it you torque the phone and the battery and it goes black .So , as soon as many of us ditched these HTC labeled batteries and either put in new ones or other manufacturer 's batteries , power problems disappeared .There is a reason these are so cheap . I found out the hard way and it took weeks to figure the exact problem when it was right under my nose .	0
Cheap for a reason . After about 3 days the head that plugs into the cigarette lighter actually broke apart . I may have had bad luck perhaps but that was my experience .	0

Horrible experience . The purchasing process was straightforward however , service changed the moment I inked the documents buyer beware ! . There was a great amount of confusion and lack of communication when I took my vehicle to United / BMW of Gwinnett for followup services It took more than a month just to have the appointment SCHEDULED ! I would n't recommend this location to anyone . As a result of the unprofessional service , we decided to purchase a second BMW from elsewhere . We 've been treated much better at both Nalley in Decatur and Global Imports save yourself a lot time and stress , and just go to one of those locations . Avoid BMW of Gwinnett , unless you want a headache . . .	0
This battery was a great price and it works well with the phone . I received the battery super fast which was very helpful .	1

After finally getting the size right , this bra does the job ! The first 2 were too large and did n't minimize at all , but with the correct size it does ! First ordered a 42DD , then 42D , but the 40D fit the best . . .never really know as all bras seem to fit differently . It is very feminine and not overly large and bulky like some out there , and does n't come up into my armpits . The straps stay in place and the Periwinkle is beautiful .	1

I already had 2 of these bras and decided to order 2 more because it always seems like they discontinue the ones I like . Very comfortable without underwires . They wash very well . I have chosen to air dry them because I think it makes them stay nice longer .	1

They were very helpful in finding me a tire they did not carry . They even called another Audi dealer to make sure they had one and asked them to put it on hold with my name on it . Above and beyond what I ever expected . Darrick Thames made sure my tire was replaced quickly and I was back on the road to a very important meeting .	1

I am hourglassy and have a little bit of a tummy pooch after having my baby a year and a half ago . This suit is very supportive and very flattering to my shape . It is comfortable .Regarding some other peoples reviews , I ordered the top in black and the fabric lining on mine is black , not white , so they probably fixed that problem . Also the cups are sewn to the inside lining , so no slipping pads after washing them !	1

these fit perfectly . I have room at the end of my toes and my heels fit like they 're suppose to . the width is fine also . they arrived earlier than expected and were very well packaged . I 'm very pleased with this purchase .	1
I like this because it REALLY GLOWS ! ! It 's Soft and rubbery , which is a nice grippy texture in your hand . It is hard to get out of your pocket for the same reason though .	1
I have purchased this product before and I really liked it . This time , however , I suspect the formulation has been changed . It has a horrible flavor , like a saccharin taste and it really does n't taste like chocolate at all . It is barely palatable with Hershey 's syrup added and with milk . I bought this on the subscription but I will be cancelling it . This company really needs to change the recipe because this stuff is nasty .	0

I have been looking for a cream to replace the now discontinued Lansinoh 3 in 1 diaper cream , if you are to , I highly suggest you keep looking . I used this when my daughter was on antibiotics and had horrible diarrhea , I immediately used this cream in hoped that it would prevent any rash , it did n't work at all , I kept using this and needless to say she ended up with a raw butt and I ended up emptying out my last bit of Lansinoh cream .This stuff smells horrible , you can smell it just holding your baby . I would n't mind the bad smell if this worked as great as people stated .And before people start wondering if I had her sit in her diaper , no , never . I 'm a stay at home mom and I was changing her diaper even when she was wet .	0
I bought this because the reviews were raving so much about what a great product it was . I 'm generally a bit hesitant to buy LG equipment due to past experiences , but this headset has been amazing so far ! I only hope that I can get many years of use out of it . I no longer get discomfort from over the ear headsets Nokia BH503 and I do n't have the cords that generally come with ear buds . I have n't found a need for custom ear buds the ones included have worked very well for me .After about 46 hours , I occasionally get a little discomfort in my ear , but it is usually just because I pushed in the ear buds too hard . Taking them out for 20 minutes and putting them back in more careful generally fixes the issue .I was a little worried about sound quality , but I 've been pleasantly surprised . The sound quality on these is much better than my Samsung wired ear buds . It is equal to my Nokia BH503 over head BT headset but with the comfort of these , they are the clear winners . I also purchased these for family members and they have all loved them so far , even purchasing additional sets for their household .Great design and implementation by LG !	1

My Razr is up to date firmware / software .Its like this is a aftermarket product , not something actually from Motorola .My guess is this is a software problem . . .	0
David Morgan at Kuni Chevrolet Cadillac provided excellent customer service . He did not just helped me get the car I wanted , but also helped me get it at the price I wanted , and that is very rare these days . Very impressed for the customer service he provided , and I would definitely come back to this dealership just because of him . Thank you Sir for your assistance . Looking forward to see if Kuni Chevrolet can continue to provide this quality of customer service in the long term . I know the power of reviews , and will come back to update their quality of service for the long term .	1
I knew within 2 seconds of putting this thing on that it was exactly what I was after . The fit is perfect , and it 's as thin as hard cases get . Protects the front a tiny bit which is unexpected and nice . Top and bottom are exposed but that 's fine for my needs . The phone feels more solid with this thing on , unlike every other case I 've ever used . I got the red but I 'll probably buy 2 more to have color options ! Time will tell on the finish , but it looks promising .	1
My sister brought the car to them and told them that there is an annoying sound when you 're making a turn . They told her that they could NOT find any issue , there is NO problem . My sister asked me to check on it and easily told her it 's the CV axle , it needs to be replaced . She came back to the dealership Farmington Hills and told them what I told to her . They gave her a quote and it was unreasonably priced yes , I know it would be pricey but not to that extend that they quoted . My sister was n't ready for that , nonetheless , they still charged her for diagnosis . But why . . ? What did they diagnosed ? They could n't find the simple issue on the car in the first place , and then you tell them about it and charged you for that . Can you explain this Audi Farmington Hills ?	0
They sent a little teeny tiny tube , and a tiny jar of creme .I do n't know if it actually works , but I could n't bring myself to pay for this stuff that seems to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced for the teeny quantity they ship . I returned it .The picture makes it look like something you 'd buy in a store . I do n't think I 've ever seen anything this tiny in any store and nobody would probably buy it if they saw it in a store because it 's so small .If you do n't mind feeling like a sucker after you see the size of what they shipped you and what you paid a ton of money for , maybe it works ? I 'll never know .	0

RUN ! ! ! ! DO NOT BUY ! ! ! ! ! Normally I read the product reviews to help me make decisions on if the product is worth the buy . I was in such an hurry to get the item that I did not even take the time to read all of the feedback that everyone was leaving . I have had the armband for less than a week and it is already tearing apart . You ca nt file a claim because you are buying it through Amazon so you have to pay to have it shipped back only to get what you paid for it back so basically if you like being stuck in the butt without Vaseline buy it because you ultimately lose so I must admit that this is one of the worse purchases I could have ever made so hopefully you read this and when you do if you still consider buying it take 5 bucks and walk up to someone and give it away because technically that is what you will be doing .	0
I tried this for the first time 2 days ago . The first thing I noticed when I started brushing my teeth is the flavor almost salty but not too terrible . It is minty but not too strong , which I appreciate . As I 'm brushing I can feel a gritty texture on my teeth . I am surprised it is this gritty since this product is for sensitive teeth . Would n't an abrasive toothpaste make your teeth more sensitive ? I 'm not qualified to answer that question but it might be good for those of us with sensitive teeth to ask our dentists if this could create a problem for us . As I 'm finishing up brushing my teeth my tongue starts feeling like it 's burning ! I spit out the toothpaste and my tongue is bright red . I gargled and rinsed my mouth out with water . A few minutes later my tongue stopped burning but felt really raw and numb . I thought maybe it was because it had some numbing ingredients to ease tooth pain . I looked on the ingredients list and even though it says Orajel on the box , it does n't contain benzocaine in it , which I thought might explain the numbness .Yesterday when I had breakfast my tongue felt extremely numb . I 'm really starting to worry my tongue stills feels oddly numb . I 've used numbing gels before and usually the numb feeling lasts only a few hours at the most . I wanted to use this product for at least a couple weeks to see if it would whiten my teeth or help with sensitivity but I 'm scared to try it again until I know my tongue will go back to normal .Update 5 / 29 / 13 My tongue finally feels back to normal but it took about a month for that numbness to completely go away . I 'm so relieved that feeling did n't last forever but I wo n't be using this toothpaste again .	0
I brought this battery early in February of this year , I normally use it daily , since I past whole day out I used it to keep my iPhone 5 alive , well last week it stop working , suddenly , I was charging my phone as I always do , the blue lights were turned on and suddenly they turn off and the phone stops charging , I try to turn it on again and nothing happens , also connect it to see if i was discharge and nothing happened it just stop working .So you better not buy this , because at the befogging it was great but if only going to work for 7 weeks then you should get a better brand	0

If you are a D .E . shaver then do not use this product ! It is not a good fit for mug and brush , the lather is thin . On the label it tout 's 34water activated molecules34 , I tried this product with various states of hydration and it was no good in all states . Although it is slick , that does n't make a good shave medium . Nicks and cuts , here you come ! Good old cheapo Williams is a far better product . If you are a cartridge shaver , I suppose this is fine , although you could also use whatever soap or body wash and get away with it just fine . Threw the tube away , will not repeat .	0

I would stay away from here at least the used car section . We had preapproved credit elsewhere , but they still ran a hard credit check after assuring us they would n't .

This did not work at all . The directions say take one or two tablets 30 minutes to an hour before you want to be asleep . We are also told they are chewable . I wanted to be asleep at 9 PM . I chewed one tablet at 815 PM . It had a grape taste . At 915 , still awake and not sleepy , I swallowed a second one without chewing it perhaps it would have a greater effect . It still did not work . At 115 , I wondered if I should take an ambien or Tylenol PM . I decided not to do so because of fear of overdoing medicines . I hardly slept the entire night .

Bike is fine , this is not a review on the bikes they sell , more of the service they provide . . . I had been in contact with the dealership for about 2 and a half weeks prior to going to pick up my bike . I live two hours away from the dealership so I made a deposit on the bike and got approved for credit , more than a week before I went down to pick up my bike . I told the saleswomen I was working with that I would be there Sat . the 23rd at opening , to which she told me she would meet me at the door . I got there when they opened , to be told she was out of the office taking a nursing test , which is great . Things like that come up but she would have known about that when I told her I was coming down . Not the biggest deal that she could not help us as there was someone else who was filled in and up to date on what has and needs to happen . First off the guy did not know what bike we were picking up , that I was trading a bike in , or that I had made a deposit along with already having approval for the credit . I laid it out step by step , feeling like the guy was looking down on me , even though he claimed he was only two years order than myself , still acted like a bit of a stick up . He finally figured out what was going on and took me back to see my bike , I checked it out and said let us get the paper work signed so I can leave . About and hour and a half after arriving at opening , again I had an appointment set up , I was told they needed to appraise my bike first before they could finish the paperwork on the one I was taking home . About 30 minutes prior to this , I was under the impression that the bike was in their shop getting looked over and it was to only take 4045 minutes to finish up . Four hours after getting there , again I was told everything would be ready for me to fill out and leave , we sat down to do paper work . I will not go into details about the tradein process as that would make this a lot longer , but heaven forbid you go in there to trade in a bike with clear turn signals even though they had ones that are clear on the floor . . . because they will charge you 70 bucks plus labor against the cost of your trade in . . . really , 70 bucks for y all to put on some turn signals ? ? It has nearly been a week since I went in and left with my new bike , I was told to give them 5 days in order for the paperwork to be sent to the DMV I requested . I got a notification from UPS yesterday saying I had a package I needed to sign for at my house in Colorado . I can not sign for it as I am ten hours away at school and I can only guess that it is the paperwork that was to be sent to the DMV as the dealership also sent me the check that was their responsibility to send to the bank to handle the pay off for the bike I traded in . . . completely unprofessional , not only did they give me terrible service in the shop , they basically stole a bike from me , then shipped paperwork that was their responsibility to handle to my house ten hours away . For the record , yes they had the address for both the DMV and the bank to finish paying the bike off . Now my father has to take time out of his day to go to the bank which is nowhere near my home to turn in the check that is their mess and responsibility , and since I am not where I can sign for the package , then I am not sure how the bike will get registered when all they had to do was send the letters to the correct place . . . I was a customer , not a mule to run your letters and checks around town .	0

I have been to multiple dealerships and this one stood out by far . The sales manager Mike and his sales associate Max went out of their way to find the exact vehicle I wanted , with the features , and for an affordable price . I was sad to see my previous Kia get flooded out in the hurricane after only having it two years , but I do really love my new kia too . Definitely recommend this dealership !	1
I got one of these brushes from a guy on Ebay who felt bad about using animal hair from a badger . Luckily I feel no remorse . It is the best shave brush I have .

Seems like this cord is hit or miss for quality . I was lucky enough to get one that works . I use it regularly on my ipad2 but also have used it on my iPod touch without problems . Works exactly as described extra long cord . I 've also used it to sync , which worked fine someone else commented that the cord does n't work for data . My guess is that the company has poor quality control , which is why a lot of people have trouble using it , or syncing with it . In any case , I would roll the dice and purchase again if I needed another . I bought this in January 2012 and it still works very well , even with daily use since I bought it . If you purchase , hope you get a good one ! UPDATE JAN 2014Still works ! I use it every night !	1

I bought the tooth brush on other site 3 months ago .For the past 2 weeks it started to act crazy . The power button not working and the brush not stopping .the only way to stop it is by placing it into the charger but it constantly charging and let be honest not that environment friendly .I had some spare time and I called Oral B .They told me I need to pay for shipping and send it to their factory .The people will touch all over my tooth brush , take it apart and send it to me .She told me to read them the number on the toothbrush then she told me it 's out of warranty .Thanks oral B for making me the consumer that bought this product 3 months ago not liable for replacement .I told her it 's said ORAL B on it so most likely it 's not a super copy that made in china and bought for 2 that 's the real thing .I do n't think she got my point I just told her I 'll find the receipt and that is the process I 'll need to follow after find a receipt for a product I bought 3 months ago1st No one touching my tooth brush kinda yaki2nd so for 23 months until the surgery for my tooth brush is done I 'll have no toothbrush3rd The waiting time , spending my energyBottom line Is it worth 50 ?

Hassled me for months to buy a truck from them . I have some challenges that make getting what I want difficult on any dealership , but they said they specialized in that sort of thing they could get it done . 6 days they were supposedly working on a deal for me which turned out to be a lie , I just got put on the back burner till they got around to me . They finally on the 6th day actually tried to get me a deal , one in which they were trying to screw me on my trade in , when they could n't get it done they did not even let me know , I had to text the sales guy and he just responded that they could not get it done . That was it no alternative maybe a different route just sucks to be you , your a waist of our time . All car dealers are crooks and lairs , but these guys are the poster children for crooked car dealers . They lied to me throughout the entire process and had no real interest in helping me move into another vehicle . I do not recommend doing business with them . Go to World Car Nissan they are much more honest and up front .	0

there is a problem with the rating buttons , i click on them and it say 's sorry , there was a problem . i ca n't leave a rating it wo n't let me past this point . here is the review i was going to post . did you like the film ? definetly what 'd you think of the acting , directing , cinematography , writing , etc ? it was well thought out . is this for kids , adults , any age ? anyone of any age will love this movie . overall take on the movie simply the best movie i have seen in a long time , it had a great storyline and they actually did their homework on this movie , it made me feel like this could actually happen , the science was there . i 'm looking forward to a sequal , and i hope it happens . george m saul .	0

I buy all of my supplements based on Consumer Lab reviews . It illustrates the brands that the amount of ingredients that are advertised and also checks the quality of the ingredients in general .Anyways , I bought this as part of a routine that I 've put together to reduce my menstrual pain each month . I have Endometriosis and finding natural ways to combat pain has been a journey . I heard that Borage Oil is great for it and along with my other supplements , I have noticed a big difference in my pain level . It also helps with the flow itself .I take 1 pill everyday and the week before my period , I take 2 pills in the morning and 2 in the evening . I would definitely recommend this for women who need some help with menstrual relief .	1

I lived for a couple of years with a roomie who would buy whatever brand of paper towel was on sale . I would always buy Bounty and would almost weep when I saw any other Brand in the towel holder . If you are using paper towels as napkins , sure , any will do , but if you are going to use your paper towel to scrub surfaces or pick up spills , in my mind , only Bounty will do ! These rolls really are huge and just make it into my towel holder . My only preference would be to buy the ones you can tear off half a sheet because there are times when a whole sheet of Bounty is overdoing it !	1
This is a revision of the review I did when I received my Muk Luks . After having worn them for two / three days I find that they have increased by about two sizes . And because they have stretched so much each time I put them on my feet create a new pattern on the very thick spongy soles . I do n't like this feeling . Since I have worn them and stretched them I ca n't return them so it is my bad , However , I would advise everyone not to purchase them . But if you do buy them , order them at least two sizes smaller than you normally wear . And do n't worry when you put them on and they seem too small . After a couple of days they will be ok .	0

Excellent ServiceThe service technician Ashley Hunt is your secret weapon . It 's one thing to get good or even great service once , twice , maybe three times . I have been bringing my vehicle to Checkered Flag BMW for over 1 . 5 years and Ms . Hunt has exceeded expectations , every single time . Excellent service on a continious basis is a home run !	1

This oil smells like honey dew and bubble gum combined . I have never smelled a mango like that before . I would not recommend this if you are looking for a genuine mango scent .

Be warned before you trust them with your motorcycle . I took them my wheels and tires off the bike for tire swap and balance . They put the tire on backwards . Everyone knows motorcycle tires are directional and to be idiot proof there are arrows on the tires and imprinted on the rotor attached to the wheel , so you ca n't screw it up . Well they screwed it up and now I must make another trip back there to have it redone . I was too busy to pick them up myself so I asked my wife to picked them up on the way home from work and she did not know to look for that . I will never let them touch my bike if they ca n't even mount a tire .	0

The best protein bar I have ever had . This stuff is legit . The taste is amazing . The chocolate chunks in the bar are huge and just add to the flavor . I do n't know how they only get 1 g of sugar in each bar but I do n't care . It fills me up and that 's saying a lot because this guy loves to eat . Try them , you wo n't regret it .	1
This case does n't curve up over the top if you dropped your phone I 'm not sure what protection it would provide .There are big cutouts on the side , top , and bottom so they did n't have to put nice little port holes or buttons on it .It does n't cover up the gash from that time I dropped the phone , so if I dropped it in this case , it would have still be injured .Finally , it 's hard to press in the sleep button top one because the case sticks out beside it , making it hard to depress .My Speck case is vastly superior .	0
We bought a 2014 Cadillac CTS there 2 weeks ago today . The price negotiation was made over the phone with the understanding I 'd look over the car and if acceptable close the transaction . Upon inspection found a small dent on the drivers side and was told they would bring it into their body shop for repair . They told me to expect contact shortly to schedule . I called my sales rep Matt last Thurs to ask if they if they had booked yet and was told he 'd check and get back with me . Now another week later I still have n't heard from them . After two weeks it feels like they should have at least contacted me by now . I 'm afraid I may need to keep calling and calling till they finally live up to what was promised . The irony of course is multiple people , including the sales rep , called me multiple times when we were trying to finalize the price negotiation	0

I bought a variety pack of 15 different types of blades and they all sucked when used with this razor . It was n't because of poor technique or blade quality but basically that this razor is terrible . Ended up buying an electric Panasonic shaver and it has been the best . This razor does n't shave close enough unless you go against the grain which does n't cut any hairs but basically pulls every one out of your face . Wish I returned it but now it just sits in the drawer and probably never used again .	0
Bought one to try , worked well , so bought another . The first one burned itself up while the second one was being shipped , the second one arrived and burned itself up within about 10 seconds . Would n't be a big deal but it 's supposed to be for emergencies , so it 's unreliability causes it to fail at the worst possible moment which is what happened here . Another case of you get what you pay for . These also had that burning electronics smell and ran really hot before incinerating themselves .	0

Wo n't come back againI would never ever come back to this dealership ! Back in 2015 , my first lease was about to over mileage so I received an email from the rep from this dealership saying if I renew the lease to the new car , there wo n't be any additional fees but I can walk out with the new car . So I went there and a sales guy , Fran , and the financial manager , Paymon , helped me to get the second car . At the time they seemed nice and helped me to get the new car and made it look like my first car was closed . BUT after that , I received some calls from Lexus saying my first car account has not been closed and they wonder why I stopped making the bill . So I told them that those guys from dealership were supposed to clear everything and that 's why I got this second car . So I called the dealership and talked to these guys and they said everything will be ok , no worries . But I received the registration bill from DMV and paid for it since I had zero idea that fee was for MY FIRST Car ! ! ! Went back to dealership and spoke with them again and they laughed at me saying that was DMV fault . You did n't have to pay anything since your first car account was closed already ! But this is n't the ending . A year and 6 months after I got the second car , some DEBT collector from Toyota started calling me saying I still own the 5 payments ! ! And the first car account was never been closed ! So went back to the dealership AGAIN and spoke with the sales manager , Johnny , he said he will talk to Lexus manager and will follow up with me . Next day Paymon called me saying Lexus will handle and take care of everything . So I was happy with their decision and let them handle this . However , a month later , the collector called me AGAIN and non of the people from this dealership called them or handle . Now what this poor dealership says is since they paid the overmileage fees , they have nothing to do with this payments but that was not the deal when I went to see them first ! ! I would never ever get the second car if there would be some remaining payment left for the first car yet they were the one promised me that I wo n't have any fees or payment so that I could get the new car from them again . I was too stupid to work with these guys also referred my friend to buy a brand new car . First of all , what kind of people would expect if there 's any remaining balance exist after returning that car and get the new car ! The way how it works is to credit that on the monthly payment for the new car ! It 's definitely not fair to hear that kind of payment exist AFTER OVER A YEAR ! I will never bring my friends to this place because I do n't want them to have the same experience ! ! Again if you want to save money and time , I definitely go to see other dealerships . You might be happy at first but you might have the worst ending later on or THEY WONT HELP YOU WHEN YOU NEED THEIR HELP ! I have no choice but I guess I may have to file this to small court again these guys and dealership since they are not cooperative anymore . I hope you guys wo n't have this all mess for your next car .	0

NT135 T is an amazing portable battery ! It is a little heavier than an old version that I purchased a few years ago but I few that the NT135 T has a much more durable case and the charging time on my HTC One was cut almost in half with the new 2 .1 Amp charging port ! I love that there are both a 2 .1 and 1 Amp charging ports and that the in port to charge the battery pack is the common phone charger mini usb . With this battery you will never have a phone battery die again ! Back to My Reviews	1
I was interested in purchasing a BMW 330i manual . I checked around to several dealerships in the East and discovered only two locations had that particular car in stock . One was located in Charlotte and the other was at BMW of the Main Line in , Bala Cynwyd , PA . I preferred the options of the automobile that this location offered and asked about the 2500 rebate that the Charlotte location was offering for new cars . The sales manager , Jesse Lurito , proceeded to tell me the rebate was only for leases . When I provided the information to him from the website indicating it was for finance purchases as well , he never responded or got back with me . I ultimately purchased from the Charlotte location . It 's not surprising why the customer satisfaction ratings are so low at this location . I would have expected more from a sales manager .	0

I ended up ordering a second pair of these because I like them so much . I am currently pregnant and have already had some varicose veins so I knew I would need a good pair of these .

I workout regularly 45 times a week and I eat pretty much healthy foods / balanced diet . I am not fat or overweight , I am pretty much active overall . However , despite all that I still have some fat surrounding my mid section that slowly crept up after age 40 and that wo n't go away . From all the great reviews in here I decided to give Jarrow Formulas Conjugated Linoleic Acid CLA a try and see if that would help me lose that extra stubborn fat . Well , it did n't . I 'm not sure If I got a different bottle of CLA from everyone else here or what , but this did n't do a thing for me . I took the recommended dosage described on the bottle and again continue a balanced healthy diet and exercise routine and finished the entire bottle and nothing changed at all same weight and same measurements from when I started taking the the CLA . I have also tryed other supplements like KetoDHA , Carbtame etc . , etc . and none of these snake oils worked . I 'm not sure why so many people in reviews say they do unless it 's the placebo effect or maybe it works better on more over weight individuals . Anyway , having said that , I will still keep looking for that miracle in a pill . Oh well . . . . .	0
I looked for a jeans belt for a long time and some of the expensive ones were only fair in quality . This belt is high qulaity and very inexpensive . It is perfect for me . It 's high quality , stiff enough that it wo n't warp or bend so much from wear . I highly recommend this belt .	1

It has been more than 1 month and a half since I got a lease from this dealer and they have n't pay the car that I trade in . I had to pay my old car in order to avoid a late fee because they did n't . When I call they never gave me an answer and nobody tried to help me . This is not a fair place to do business , they only care about you before buying and then good luck trying to solve your problems . I definitely do not recommend this place for buying or leasing a car .	0

I had my eye on a particular car , and contacted Brian to schedule a test drive . He was very accommodating from the get go , arranging a test drive immediately to fit my Saturday morning schedule . I was very interested in purchasing the car , but was also considering a completely different make , and Brian did a great job understanding and addressing my questions on the car features and pricing . He and Ric Koresky were terrific in working with meno gamesmanship , but clear willingness to help get the deal done , including smart financing approaches . I felt like a valued customer , and not pressured to make a purchase . Once I made the deal , Susan Ward did a great job highlighting all the capabilities of the car , and Jemar was very helpful working through the financing . All in all , a great buying experience , and a great car !	1

Updated 8 / 30 / 2013 . Flavors tried so far Most all of them , partly via thevariety pack . All are pretty much the same except for the flavor .Looks OK , like a piece of caramel taffy with flecks of nuts in it . Not all that appetizing .Smells Not bad , light scent of nuts and whatever flavor it is .Tastes Very good . The banana bar has no taste at all until you 've chewed for a few seconds a weird experience , not replicated with the other flavors . Once the flavor comes out it 's pleasantly nutty , slighly sweet with a fair amount of banana / cinnamon / apple / etc . flavor . Some of them have bits of fruit . Little if any of the bitter aftertaste that plagues most protein bars .Feels Very chewy , slightly gritty from the generous serving of fiber . Reasonably filling .Stats Outstanding . Low fat low calories modest carbs only 57 g sugars mostly offset by a whopping 1618 g of fiber . Good quality whey / milk protein . Quality ingredients overall . One of the very few brands out there that uses sucralose instead of a nearlaxative dose of cheaper sugar alcohols .Bottom line I originally gave this three stars . After sampling some other flavors and several other brands , however , it 's now clear that Quest is one of the best protein bars out there . Once you 're past the slightly weird look and feel Quest does n't even try to imitate a candy bar as so many others do you have a goodtasting , filling bar without the carbloading penalty you pay with so many other protein bars . The only real negative is that it 's a little on the expensive side , especially the sampler pack .This is the first and only bar out of some two dozen I 've sampled to date that genuinely works as both meal replacement and a postworkout snack . This is also the first and only brand I 've reordered from Amazon . Now five stars for overall high quality and good taste .	1

Made appointment to see a vehicle . Appointment was 5 days after made . Got there had to wait 10 minutes for someone to talk to us . Had to sit and fill out questionnaire took about 10 minutes . Had to wait for someone to go to pick the car up from the detail shop down the street took about 35 minutes . When they finally got the car there it had n't been cleaned . Were told we could n't drive it . We looked to see if our family could fit and it was n't going to work out . After done no apologies for the inconveniences . Told we may want to go to another car lot because our budget did n't fit what they carried . We wo n't be back do n't worry our budget was more then I told you . We like to see how everyone is treated in business 's we deal with .	0

This cover is all about a tough look and it does that well . Snap this on and you have a precision cut well designed look for your vital instrument . Arnold S . would have this cover . A fusion of leather and polycarbonate need I say more . Macho fashionista 's this is your case . I just wish they had given it a screen cover . Great look !	1
I 'm a 41 Long Suit Size Medium FrameExecutive Summary Unfortunately , after much trial and error , I can confirm that no undershirt fits perfect . The best you 're going to get is the Jos Banks size Large followed by Dockers size Extra Large . These shirts are higher quality material than the standard Hanes and have a nice length to tuck them in even after shrinking from washing .Hanes Size Large The kind you can buy at your local big box storeHanes Comfort Soft Crew Neck 5 Pack TeePrior to Wash Length Nice tuckable lengthPrior to Wash Fit BaggyAfter Wash Length They shrank up the most of any shirt . They really are n't even tuckable now .After Wash Fit Still baggyQuality These are the thinnest of all the shirts reviewed here . The thin material , the bagginess and not being able to tuck them in , let alone keep them tucked in , is the reason I decided to try all the shirts below in search of a nicer quality better fitting shirt .Hanes Size Large TallHanes Mens Classics Tall Man Crew Neck TShirt 9856Prior to Wash Length They were as long as the Dockers Extra LargePrior to Wash Fit Baggy . Half an inch wider on each side of the shoulder than the Dockers Large .After Wash Length Nice tuckable length . A tad shorter than the Dockers Extra LargeAfter Wash Fit Tight through the shoulders though just slightly looser than the Dockers Large . They dug into my arm pits a bit . Slightly uncomfortable .Quality They are thick shirts , almost as thick as a standard t shirt nonundershirt . 2 or 3 times as thick as the standard Hanes undershirts and thicker than all other shirts mentioned here . For this reason I do n't like them .Adidas Size Largeadidas Men 's Athletic Comfort Climalite 2Pack Crew UndershirtPrior to Wash Length Reasonable tuckable lengthPrior to Wash Fit Tight all aroundAfter Wash Length Barely tuckableAfter Wash Fit Almost as tight as a compression shirt . Tightest of all the shirts . They dug right into my arm pits . Uncomfortable .Quality The material is nicer and a tad thicker than the standard Hanes you can buy locally . Way too tight to wear .Dockers Size LargeDockers Men 's 4 Pack Crew Neck TShirtPrior to Wash Nice tuckable lengthPrior to Wash Fit Comfortably loose , not really baggyAfter Wash Length Still tuckable , but they did shrink quite a bitAfter Wash Fit Tight all around , but not as tight as the Adidas . They dug into my arm pits . Uncomfortable .Quality Nice material , not too light like store bought Hanes , not too heavy like the Hanes Tall , but Jos Banks is just slightly nice , especially the collar .Note I bought a second package to confirm that I did n't receive a bad batch that overly shrank . Unfortunately the second package shrank just as much .Dockers Size Extra LargeDockers Men 's 4 Pack Crew Neck TShirtPrior to Wash Length A bit longer than the Dockers size largePrior to Wash Fit Baggy . About 2 inches wider on each side of the shoulder than Dockers size LargeAfter Wash Length Nice tuckable lengthAfter Wash Fit Baggy . They shrank up width wise so that they are about 1 inch wider than the Dockers size LargeQuality Same as the Dockers size LargeNote They are a tad too big for me , but I 'd rather have that than too small .Jos Banks Size LargeNot sure if these shirts show up in the Product Ads from External Websites , but they should if Amazon really wants to compete against the best , which is what this section of the website impliesPrior to Wash Length Slightly longer than Dockers size largePrior to Wash Fit BaggyAfter Wash Length The length barely shrank at all . They are about 3 inches longer than the Dockers size Large after washingAfter Wash Fit Slightly baggy . Between the fit of the Dockers Extra Large and Dockers Large .Quality The material is a tad nicer than the Dockers , especially the neck . Time will tell , but I imagine the neck would be the last to roll out of all the shirts I 've tried .Note I found these on sale for about the same price as the Dockers	0
I recently bought the Panasonic ESLA63 . I upgraded from the Panasonic ESLT41 K , which did not give a good shave . The Panasonic ESLA63 does a better job as long as I do n't go much longer than 24 hours between shaves . BUT , it is 120 . So , I thought I would give this Norelco shaver a try since it is so much less expensive and , because of the positive reviews on Amazon .The difference between the two shavers is stark . The Norelco feels cheap compared to the Panasonic and the shaving results reflect that lack of quality . The Norelco pulls and irritates . I believe , that one reason is because the motor speed of the Noreclo is so much slower the Panasonic . I intend to stick with the Panasonic . Yes , it is twice as much as the Norelco but the performance is so superior to the Norelco , it is worth the cost .	0
The phone charges and plays audio without a problem . This cable does n't feel cheaply made like other cables out there . Very happy with my purchase .	1
I scheduled service on my car more than a week in advance and clearly specified the need for a loaner car . I got there early the day of my appointment only to be told after waiting around for 20 minutes that there was a mixup and loaner cars would not be available until POSSIBLY the following week . The woman who handles the loaner cars was not very sincere in her apology for what she kept calling a mixup because she obviously could n't admit her mistake , nor did she acknowledge the inconvenience of wasting my time and gas for her mixup . She made no attempt to contact a manager or offer any alternatives , even when I mentioned that I usually go to another Mazda dealership , but was willing to take my business there because the location was better for me . This certainly did not give the impression that my business was appreciated . I will NOT take my car there , but rather will continue to take both of my Mazda 's to Ingram Park Auto Center where things are handled more professionally and I always feel my business is appreciated !	0
Best car buying experience I 've ever had . Henry is a great guy , laid back , no nonsense , and friendly . Even texted me after the sale when he realized I had left a few small items in by tradein . The staff as a whole was very pleasant and friendly . Facilities and inventory were world class , as one would expect at a Porsche dealer . Would n't hesitate to do business with them again .	1

I purchased this sweater two years ago and love it to pieces . I have been looking for another and found it here on Amazon . I put off buying earlier in the year from Roamans due to but will get two great colors shortly from Amazon I love Amazon 's fast shipping . It is oversized but that is what makes it great . I wear it all the time and it goes fabulously with jeans . Ca n't wait until my paycheck at the beginning of the month ! I love this sweater .	1
I purchased this for a trip to Hawaii so I could listen to Pandora on my phone while hanging out on the beach . It absolutely did not work . I tried it when my phone was fully charged and the phone battery still drained . Not worth the purchase and I wish I could get my money back . Oh well .	0

I had to have some kind of Calcium Carbonate post gastric sleeve and my weight loss was getting stuck so I investigated everything that went into my mouth I thought . THEN finally I read the labels on the vitamins and these . They taste great for a reason , 5 grams of carbohydrate which I am supposed to sharply limit times FIVE per day 25 grams of carbs from a vitamin is CRAZY ! plus I found out Bariatric Advantage protein powder mix has non dairy creamer in the first few ingredients which is a sugar ingredient for sure ! Do n't they know they are dealing with so many diabetics and people who have been struggling with carb addictions for years before going to weight loss surgery to get them seriously back on track ? ! I have boycotted ALL Bariatric Advantage products for this reason . I suggest you do so as well if you have had weight loss surgery of any type and have had issues with reducing carbs .I am writing about it here to save others the grief this might cause them as well .Because this does taste so much like sugar it was triggering cravings like crazy as well . I did n't want to take a chance anymore and threw them all out .I am sticking with Unjury products . I love them ! oh if you have a serious health problem like cancer or are n't plagued with my kind of diet issues , these are probably a good thing for you !	0
I recently purchased another brand because it came in bulk and we have multiple people in our house who use them so I thought it would be a good idea . That gave me a comparison to the Playtex brand . I have found that I definitely prefer the Playtex brand over the other . The string on the other comes apart easily and the Playtex string stays intact . I definitely prefer the applicator on the Playtex brand over the other . I also prefer the way the Playtex brand expands over the other brand . I would recommend Playtex over any other brand , as it seems to be the one that fits better for my needs .	1
all i want is to buy tickets with my gift card . what does unable to process your request mean ? any particular reason ? are the tickets sold out ? how about some explanation ? it seems like a pretty simple request , but if it 's too difficult for fandango then i guess i 'll just have to buy the tickets in person like the old days . i should have realized that convenience is impossible to find online .	0
Terribly disappointed that they do nt stand behind their whole product . Bought a new Mini hardtop with Navigation . Turned out the map address data had a major defect for Houston many of the downtown areas were in Clutch City rather than Houston . This caused the navigation system to not be able to locate places . I had to contact the company that makes their navigation maps myself to get the data updates corrected . Never received a thank you from Mini of the Woodlands , nor did they replace my flawed data part . They expected me to buy one . Makes me wonder what other parts of their product they do nt stand behind .	0
Cathy was very friendly and took good care of me . She found the exact car I wanted and had it shipped in and prepped for me in six days . This is the 3rd Cadillac I 've bought from Don Thornton and I 'm still pleased with the way things are handled on the sales side as well as the service side .	1

Many users feel the same way Derby makes a shaving blade that 's sharp , but so smooth that you might not even know you 're shaving . Not so sharp that you get razor burn , but sharp enough to give you a satisfying shave every time .	1
I rarely hate a product , but this was pretty much useless . The biggest issue was the loop that goes over your ear . It 's made of a fairly cheap , sharp and brittle plastic . I found that it was very hard on my ears and terrible to wear for more than a few minutes .Sound quality was terrible , and at least on my S4 , it did n't translate into good quality for the people I was talking to .I returned this , making it one of the few things I 've returned to Amazon over the years for the reason that well it sucked .	0
I 'm writing this on behalf of my husband , who just started using it . He 'd been using the Jack Black Beard Lube for probably about ten years , but wanted to try something different , so he ordered this . It gives SUCH a nice , clean , smooth shave ! His face is so soft afterwards , and it seems like the shave does last longer .Also , I had been worried that the eucalyptus oil and menthol in this would irritate his skin since he has sensitive skin , but they have n't at all .Overall , this is an excellent product , and since you only need to use a small amount , it should last a long time .	1
I have a Phd in Holistic Nutrition . I have read many books on iodine that were well written and nicely referenced . Since I suffer from fibrocystic breasts , I decided to take a small amount 12 .5 mg a day 1 tablet . I also have nonhashi 's thyroid disease which was being managed with 4 grains of natural thyroid NO HYPO SYMPTOMS AT ALL ! . All of the books said I should be able to lower my medication over time on Iodine . I was pretty excited ! Breast lumps should disappear . . .thyroid meds reduced . It was a win / win . WRONG ! ! ! I had all of the detox symptoms people describe . . . . .acne all over my back , chest and arms never have it there otherwise . . . .I mean tons of pimples that looked different from normal pimples . . . .Feeling icky . . . .I suffered through that . . . .the bumps subsided after about month . . . .but I never felt better on the iodine .

It showed my T3 was sky high . . . .should have been less than 4 .4 I feel best when it is at 4 .0 4 .2 and it was 5 .2 ! ! ! ! T3 is active thyroid hormone .

these are my thougts . do n't charge a hidden fee . i purchased a twenty five dollar gift card with no additional fees at register . . . wow very nice but then you sneaky bastards charge me a 2 . 50 additional fee when i purchase my tickets on line . i went to a matinee that charged only 5 . 50 but through you i had to pay 6 . 75 per person what was the point of making an effort to catch the matinee to save money when i had to give it to you greedy bastards . that was my very last friggin time and anybody else i know that will ever ever purchase your gift card . and if you have nt noticed . . . i m pissed ! btw do nt bother to contact me with a bull larkey reason why you had to charge that fee because there is nt one . it would have been different if the fees were up front and shown somewhere prior to purchase than i could have made a sound decision whether to purchase or not . out out ripped off .	0
We found the perfect used car online at this dealership . We are from Indianapolis , so we called before making the drive to Cincinnati to be sure the car was still there and to let them know we were driving a distance to come to see it . We were told it was there and that they would have it pulled up and waiting on us when we arrived . They took down our contact info and names . When we got to the dealership they acted confused about what car we were there to see . Come to find out , the car was transferred to their Ford store after further research we discovered they do not have a Ford dealership in the hour and a half since our phone call . The did not bother to call to tell us or even apologize for the inconvenience . Instead , Raj whom we had spoken to on the phone tried to tell us about an older car with higher miles on it that we were by no means interested in . This dealership was a complete waste of time and I would recommend them to no one . We would have been paying cash that day for the car we called about and they allowed us to walk out of the store without so much as a decent apology .	0
I was afraid I 'd be sacrificing quality due to the price , but I ordered this watch box anyway after considering several choices here on Amazon and after much debate . Anytime a product has glass or plastic fragile components , I always worry about shipping as well . Thankfully , this watch box was packaged nice and tight and arrived in perfect condition . And the quality of it is perfect . It 's a nice matte finish with chrome hinges and of course , the clear plastic lid gives it a nice classy look . It 's not too heavy either . Beware of the size though I had to make a special place for it , but it really shows off my watches nicely and is a nice accent piece . My only complaint is that I 've already filled it up ! Would make a great gift for the watch enthusiast !	1

The employees was very helpful and patient with my requests and needs . I look forward to working with them again . I was very pleased with the great customer service thanks again	1
The printing on this case is really well done . Deep , saturated purples and dark greens with lighter green , purple and oranges I have the Paths design . The color scheme works very well at least to my eye and the geometric design is quite nice . The colors are on the face the edges and back are white .The case itself seems well made . It 's plastic , but appears sturdy . It fit perfectly on my iPhone .It comes nicely packaged in a clear plastic case , which is great for protection when it is being shipped in case the person packing the box skimps on wrapping .Sample provided for review	1

Good protection , not for 1st timers . The process of placing this product on your device is a little more work than other screen protectors . However I do n't believe they will protect your phone as well	1
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy	0
Several of them were scratched up pretty bad .The metal tip at the end of the stylus had come off and were floating around the packaging . Some I was able to put back on and some kept fallling off exposing the rubber capacitive tip .The paint on the plastic clips were chipped .The white styluses were scratched and had dark / black scratches and marks all over it .I ordered two packages of them and returned them both .Poor quality .	0
Car Wash Service Is AwfulTerrible service . Promise you free car washes then after you buy their rude servicemen do everything they can to discourage you from ever using it . One hour to 1 . 5 hour wait for the equivalent of 3 wash . Lexus of Naperville has far superior service , clean inside and out as they hire enough to do it and prioritize customer vehicles whereas mercedes leaves you in line while they wash cars on lot .	0
There is no excuse for this product . Its price is outrageous , and it is ineffective . MG217 , which costs a fraction as much , is also a far more effective treatment . I have no idea whythey are both tar in roughly the same strengthbut that 's how it is . No need to waste your money	0

I ca n't even begin to tell you all the ways I was cheated at this dealership . They cheated me out of 1000 Uber incentive because they did n't know how to do it . They cheated me into financing 399 for a pulse system that they CLAIMED was required by the state it is not when it was not listed on the window sticker and was not requested by me . They wasted hours of my time playing their games with the financing because they did n't do what I asked them to the first time , 72 months , zero money down . And they tried to cheat me into financing at 8 . 99 interest rate when I KNEW I qualified for at worst 4 . 99 because I had already run my FICO score . I ended up approved for 4 . 79 . I was referred to this dealership by a friend and so was certainly not expecting this . It was without a doubt , the worst experience I have ever had purchasing a car . I will never go back to Larson Hyundai , even for an oil change .	0
Great place ! ! Love how they go all out for the MX finals ! !	1
I had a cheap 12 mount that did is job , but broke twice . This one is just plain easier to use , better build quality , everything is just easier . The released button is on the back so you can simultaneously hold on to your phone and release it at the same time . . . the other one I had took two hands . This one has a knob you turn to tighten the suction cup , while the other had a lever . This is a really great mount . The only bad part is the price31 .50 is a bit high to pay for any mount in my opinion . Still better than buying 12 ones that keep breaking though .	1
Just what I was looking for ! I love how the tip at the end is covered . No longer am I JABBING myself with the sharp pick end while flossing . The mint flavor is mild , and just enough . Seems to be slightly waxed for easier gliding in and out of tight teeth . Floss holds on well , even when I have to struggle a little to glide it out of some of my tighter molars . Nice sturdy plastic too . I 'll be back for more . Recommend !	1

This device has very specific instructions . Plug it into a charger and into your phone , ensure charging is happening , and then into the HDMI port .Plugging it in as a charger . . . works about 2 / 3 of the time , on a highoutput charger . And often takes a minute or so to register . Using a USB cable directly , same charger , same tablet , the response is instant , 100 of the time .Next , the HDMI . The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8 .4 AKA SMT320 never was able to recognize that HDMI was connected . I tried an ASUS PQ321 , a Samsung PN50B650 and an Oppo 103D . The latter has a powered MHL HDMI port . NONE of these work . NONE .Possibly the problem is the Samsung tablet software . But given the flakiness of it recognizing that the charger was attached , I think there 's something faulty in the Skiva dongle .But wait . . . there 's more ! I went to the Skiva website there 's no useful data there . So I used the Contact Support email link . It 's a nonworking Google groups email address . I 'm not kidding mailing supportskivatech .com resulted in . . .Message rejected by Google Groups . Please visit . . . to review our Bulk Email Senders Guidelines .There 's no email address , physical address or phone number on the package , though the return address is Lexington , Kentucky .This is a 12 device . But it does n't work . Return it for 12 ? Probably not . It 's not just defective , it 's petty theft .Update I ordered theEEEKit adapter , which does work . It comes with what looks like thePatuoxun Micro USB 5 Pin to 11 Pin HDMI HDTV MHL Adapter Converter For Samsung S3 I9300 , and that has to be inline to the tablet . So I tried that inline to the Skiva . It worked , but did block charging which the Skiva was n't doing reliably anyhow .That 's a 6 part . Perhaps the Skiva needs a bit more circuitry to work with the Galaxy Tab Pro .	0
I bought this with high hopes and was let down . Shipping took longer than expected and when I finally got it It was nt good . The bottom part of the case kept slipping off of my phone . I really wanted a bamboo case and thought this would be nice and simple . Litterally threw it into the trash because it would not stay on	0
And it still would n't fit me in the slightest . Made wayyyy small for those of you interested in buying it . Pretty chiffon creased from shipping but okay material No stretch , nothing . Unless you 're super petite , I would n't bother .	0

Routine service on my NX200TAs usual , Lexus of Lehigh Valley performed in a professional courteous manner .

When I wore this , it would record that I 'd walked over a hundred steps when I only walked down the hall . I tried wearing it in different places waist band , top pocket , but nothing worked .

Brought my Indian Roadmaster in for my 500 mile checkup and to check on a unusual noise coming from underneath . Found out from the service department that it would take longer to service if I did n't buy the bike at Big 1 . They were telling the truth . Six days later I was told my bike was ready , only after I called them to ask , plus the noise was still there . Ca n't say that I have ever had to wait 6 days for basic maintenance .

This was absolutely the worse auto repair I have ever experienced . Based upon the total lack of service , I will NEVER return to a BMW dealership for any service , and owning two 2 3 series , I will take them other repair firms that actually perform the service requested and with honesty , both of which this dealership lacks . There are too many excellent BMW repair firms to be lied to by this dealer go anywhere else	0

wonder why they are so cheap ? well its because they are cheaply made . like most screen protectors they have a film on both sides that you remove to apply to the screen . well it went on well . but when removing the front film it actually peeled away some of the gloss coating . like peeling oxidized clear coat off a car .70 is still there and it looks ok but not the way it should . good for a dollar though . i 've had mine on for about a month . sides beginning to peel so it will be time to change soon .	0
This company must be making a pretty penny off of these plastic things .

We scheduled an appointment to have a Sonic check engine light looked at under warranty . When we scheduled we were told if it was under warranty there would be no charge . The day we brought the vehicle in the check engine light went out on the way . Rhonda called us and told us they scanned the computer and that there were no codes . She charged us the full diagnostic . When we picked it up we asked if they were going to charge us if the light came back on . Rhonda assured us that we would not . The light of course came back on . Rhonda was not there when we returned it . The guy in the drive lane immediately scanned it and said it was not the same thing . . . . . . funny . . . . they said the light was not on , so no code were there . The code was of course covered by the powertrain warranty . When we asked for the money back for the initial diagnosis everyone got defensive . They did not call us back as they said they would .

It outputs to my LCD tv from my GSII as expected . I purchased this for my wife so my only experience is from when I initially powered it up to test it out after first connection and it worked well . It is rather light , plastic of course and seems sturdy enough to last a good while , as long as you do n't manhandle it .If my wife ever gets around to using it I 'll ask her about ease of use , reliability etc .	1

I bought these sandals locally sorry , Amazon . I have Achilles tendonitis plus a spur on my right heel . These fit perfectly and work for summer . All the rest of my Orthaheel shoes were bought from Amazon 4 Pair , and I do n't know what I would do without them . I hope everyone with this problem or plantar fasciitis should first visit a podiatrist , then buy these shoes unless he / she suggests something else . I love the coral colored pair , too , that is on Amazon , but do n't think I should buy any more shoes unless I change my last name to Marcos Also , you can adjust this sandal in 4 ways , so I ca n't imagine their being uncomfortable , as I am also dealing with bunions .	1

I will never be taking my car here again because of the dishonesty I experienced today . I had a 10 am appt . and they took my car to get an oil change . While there they asked me if I wanted my tires rotated and I said yes . After almost waiting 90 minutes they said my car was ready and charged me for the oil change and tire rotation . As I approached my car I have three rims that are the same and one different , I saw the wheel with the different rim in the same spot . I went back in and asked them if my tires were rotated ? They said oh no they did n't do it and issued me a refund . If it was n't for that rim I would 've never known . They kept my car for 90 minutes to make me think that they were rotating my wheels . How dishonest and ugly . How malicious and untrustworthy . I will never go there again . Makes me wonder if they ever did maintenance on my car whenever I brought it in . Probably not . Just awful .	0
This did not fit my S4 well . It just barely held on and while some of the cut ups lined up like the camera other 's did n't like the speaker . It also oddly enough effected my Blutooth connectivity . I 'm not sure how but I could remove it , connect and get good range . Then install it and get constant cut outs on my Blutooth headphones . It feels cheap , but is soft and gives a good grip . But I was always afraid that it would just pop off since it barely held onto the corners . I 'm back to running no case but having a happier phone .	0

A simple test to see if a diet supplement works is to simply eat the way you normally eat and working out to the same degree / amount . If you lose weight , you can make the argument that the supplement is working .I tested this ' miracle weigh loss ' with that methodology and found it did ' nada ' for losing weight . There is not miracle here .I'm convinced that people who claim weight loss have either worked out more or cut calories . . .or both .Buyer beware on Green Tea Extract .	0
Purchased a new RX350 F SportI worked with Reid McCann and he was incredibly helpfull without being pushy . I first met Reid about two weeks ago as I went through my evaluation process .

bought this Kinivo BTC450 bluetooth receiver from amazon marketplace seller BlueRigger for forty bucks . this is working in my car with my iPhone 5 . all you have to do is plug this kinivo 's charger into the cigarette lighter and plug the kinivo 's audio wire into the AUX jack in the car , plug a lightning cable into this kinivo 's charger and into the iPhone to recharge the iPhone , and then pair the kinivo bluetooth with the iPhone , and it simply works . this kinivo remembers the iPhone whenever turning on the car . the music from my iPhone 5 plays great in the car using this kinivo . you can pause the music and go forward or backwards a song using the simple controls on this kinivo . personally have not tried using this for taking phone calls , because already also using a bluetooth earpiece for calls . but personally very happy with this kinivo for playing music from my iPhone in the car via bluetooth without having to directly connect a cable from the headphone jack on the iPhone . in addition to using this kinivo , also using theMacally MCUP holderto hold the iPhone in place in the car .	1

I was really excited when I received this item . It appeared sharp looking , good fit and with all the reviews , I thought I was done shopping for an iPhone case .I am extremely disappointed ! ! This case does n't fit no matter what I do . I thought maybe I bought the wrong case , so I tried it on an iPhone 3 , 3 G , 4 and it would not fit on any of them . I 've come to the conclusion that I 've wasted my money . The iPhone is flat , this cover is curvy . I do n't understand how anyone who left a review can say that this is a good product .I'm mailing it back , and yes I 'm also expected to pay for the shipment to return it . The cost combined to have it shipped to me the cost to send it back more than the cost of the case itself .I'm extremely disappointed .	0

This location is terrible . It took 30 min for them to pull the car around when we showed up .

They have no regard for customer service .	0

Very disappointed , they had a preowned vehicle for sale on their website , I called about the vehicle , the internet sales person was nice and friendly but had no clue about the actual car condition . I told her before I drive there 4 hours a way need to make sure the car has no rust and no previous paint work or accident , she went to the sales manager who obviously does n't care about people 's time and he said the car is in pristine condition . So I arranged an appointment and took a day of work and rented a car one way in good intention to buy the car based on our verbal conversation over the phone and based on my trust in a legitimate dealer I assumed , yes I assumed a Lexus dealer is more courteous and honest and would n't lie . I got there and what a joke , the car was painted on the whole passenger side and front of the car , also it is a rot box so rusty that the exhaust is loud , what a shame , and they wo nt even consider or even honor a customer who just drove almost 5 hours a way to buy a car . I was very pissed and if I could put a 0 star I would , and I will never ever trust such dealer , my uncle buys a car their every 2 years , the new LX about a 100k . I will make sure he goes somewhere else . I end up buying a car in NJ from a Lexus dealer who really wanted to sell me a car and bought a ' 15 LX570 when I was going to buy an LX470 for Lexus of Manhattan because I really was about to buy their ' 14 LX570 they had there instead , but their attitude and carelessness about their customer made me not even bother . The Lexus dealer in NJ actually gave me 5k off from the list price . So please take my advise do not bother going there for a preowned car because they do n't care about you and their cars are overpriced vehicles , rattle boxes , and rust buckets . I am very mad but glad at the same time that I bought a car somewhere else . I ca nt explain what I went through in words by taking their word over the phone .	0
I hesitated on writing a review for the service department , but the situation is ridiculous . Prior to my last two repairs I have always made an appointment to service my vehicle and everything was fantastic . The last two visits have been without appointments because they were issues that could not wait the over week and a half time frame for the next available appointment seriously ? ! . I understood that the repair needed for the first appointment took time and I appreciated that they were attentive , but they severely lacked on follow through and communication . On the second visit , things are ridiculous . It appears I need an AC recharge and since it 's summer it 's not something that I 'd want to put off and again appointments were only available a week and a half later . I went in at 10 am Tuesday and was told to come at 7 am the following day to ensure that my car would be looked at and serviced by the end of the end , so I did that . Fast forward to 445 Wednesday yesterday , I had to call and find it had n't even been brought into the shop ! What 's the logic in telling a customer to bring a car in early when it 's not even going to be looked at on that given day . Yes , I realize I did n't have an appointment , but come on ! I finally just called right now and it 's the same unimpressive response of , We 're getting the car in the shop today and I 'll call you at 5 pm . It 's not surprising that I m extremely irritated at this point . I know I could 've taken my car elsewhere , but when your vehicle is still under warranty you really ca n't do that because if you have other issues that arise , it could easily be blamed on going outside of the Hyundai network for service . But this lack of timely response for nonappointments is ridiculous , if I was able to hold off for over a week and come in with an appointment I would 've . This is completely frustrating and unacceptable . I sure hope the general manager , Ashish K . Desai , sees this but not hopeful .	0
I own a Rolex Sub this watch looks almost identical for a mere fraction of the price . This watch does not manually wind first position out of the screw down should allow it to be wound Do n't know if I received a bad one but my other Invicta auto 's all manually wind which I like because without the manual wind the watch will inevitably not hold time overnight .That 's a real shame because this watch really does impress me otherwise .Update 13 Dec 2012 . . . . . . . . . . . . I have to take back what I wrote about this watch not holding time overnight because it VERY definitely does . NOPE it does not manually wind but the truth is this watch is now on my wrist 24 / 7 because it deserves to be worn every day as it should I love it . I wear it ALL the time have never taken it off since original purchase . . . . . .I was the guy that put it on the bedside table ready to go to sleep then put it back on in the morning . Not any more ! If you like how it looks you 'll love how it wears ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
We were looking for something for him that was both long and absorbent and these fill the bill . They are very long . In fact , I would imagine many heavy period women could wear these as well .

I wanted something to help boost my weight loss along improving my diet and exercising and I thought this product might work but it did n't . I took it by the recommended dosage for about 3 weeks and had no change . I do n't know if it 's an issue with 7Keto itself or just what this particular company is using . I may have been a bit hasty in my decision to purchase it because when you click on most of these reviews the person has only written one review and it 's just about this product .	0

Was in on Columbus Day looking for a very specific preowned 20142015 A7 to purchase . They did n't have one in stock , so I thought I would just be leaving my contact info should they come across one . Kate Gagnon suggested a lease on a new 2017 . I felt it was going to be an exercise in futility as I needed a high mileage lease and thought there was little chance it would fit within my budget , but Kate brought the car around for a test drive while the numbers were run . Sure enough , Kate and the team were able to fit the lease into my budget and I now have a new A7 , fully warrantied and with Audi Care as well . Could n't be happier with the assistance from all I encountered .	1

I have systemic lupus , which brings with it a fair amount of pain that makes staying asleep difficult . I do not want to take prescription sleep medication , because I have a child and want to be able to wake up at the first 34Mom ! 34 I ca n't take diphenhydramine because I also have Sjogren 's Syndrome secondary to the SLE , and the antihistamine is too drying . My rheumatologist suggested valerian root , and it works very well . I still wake up from pain , but it 's easier to go to sleep , or back to sleep , and I do not have trouble waking up if my son needs me for something .This brand has been very reliable and inexpensive . I recommend it for both occasional insomnia and chronic sleep problems .	1
I ve bought two bikes over the last couple years at Powersports of Greenville and they truly stand behind their products and service . my CanAM spyder had a DPS pump to fail which is the power steering pump and sensors . it was replaced a few years ago under a recall and now having issues again . the repair cost were pretty significant but the dealership was able to get CanAm to pay for the parts and have me cover the labor . that alone saved me a significant amount of money to where the repairs could be made . my bike has been off the road for a few months as I could n't afford this repair but with the help of the awesome service team , I 'm back on the road and extremely happy ! !	1
I brought my car here about a year ago for a recall . I think it was my fuel pump but I 'm not sure . It just had something to do with gas / fuel . They said they fixed it but soon after I left my check engine light came on and it smelled like gas . I assumed they 'd done something to it to make me have to come back and pay for a repair since recalls are supposed to be free but some dealerships were trying to charge people at the height of all those GM recalls a few years ago . I did n't have any money for that so I parked it . I truly do n't drive more than twice a week so I used my grandmothers SUV instead . Lately her car needed a repair so I took mine out to run an errand . I took it to the gas station and when I filled it up a puddle of gas leaked out of my car . I did n't trust Pitre now so I took it to a independent mechanic shop . I have no proof but the mechanic said he had to fix a small ring at the top of my gas tank . This fixed all of the problems I was having . I think they intentionally or accidently broke it while they were fixing the fuel pump . I just know I do n't trust them and I wo n't be back if I can help it .	0

I normally use an Epilator for my legs and a small shaver for my bikini area , but I gave up both to try this out and it failed me miserably . When I tested this shaver on my legs , both wet and dry , it did not get as close as I wanted . I 'm not expecting epilator results , but if I can still easily grab hairs with a tweezer it 's just not doing the job . As for the bikini area , it was even worse . Because I trim daily it should have done a decent job , but it did n't and I gave up . Overall I ca n't see spending money on this especially since my favorite bikini razor sells for about 10 .	0

Knowing that this product was only 6 .00 I did n't have high expectations . . . with that said the battery lasted just as long as my regular battery did . The back cover stayed on however it did n't snap on flush meaning there were gaps in it . I used the battery consistently for a week and only charged it when it beeped at me to so it was charged between two or three times per day which was no different than my old 1500mAh battery . The other bad thing about getting this product is if you have any cases for your phone just forget about them because they will never fit . I 'm back to using my old battery with my otterbox defender case . If it sounds too good to be true then it is !	0

I wanted a diffuser , but I was frozen with indecision . There are so many brands to choose from and many varying opinions in regard to how well they work . My sister recommended a ZAQ , so I chose this one and I 'm very happy with it . I filled the reservoir to the fill line , added a few drops of essential oil , pressed the on button and instantly a mist started coming out of the top . I have it in a large bedroom and it gave the entire room a pleasant fragrance .If you press the button once to turn it on it goes through the different light colors in rotation . Press it once again at a color you like and it will remain on that color . Press again and the light goes off although the button remains lighted so you can see where to turn it off . One final press of the button turns the unit off completely . Once the reservoir is empty after several hours of run time it will turn itself off .	1
Ok so me and my wife enjoyed our experience alot at Tacoma Nissan . Honesty we was n't planning on buying a car that evening . Our sales associate Tom was really nice , and the price was very good that weekend on the Rouge so the deal was done . Honestly it 's my first Nissan and the car is great . Highly recommend tacoma Nissan .	1

Wife just got a HTC One , and it is nice but did n't have the vibe i was looking for . Look and feel are important to me as well as specs and features . After debating between using an upgrade for the G2 and getting it for 99 on amazon or waiting for a Nexus 5 I went with the G2 . I wanted a Note 3 until i used a friends . Meh , just a big screen and she already had issues and had to send it back .I root and ROM my devices because they always lack the feel I want . The G2 amazed me after a few days because I ca n't get over how much tiny tweaks there are to theme and customize it to the feel i want without voiding the warranty by rooting it . By far the best stock UI i have ever seen also . Blows away Samsungs beat old system . I wanted another Samsung until I realized that the reason i always root and rom is that samsung just does n't make a good UI for my taste .Specswise this phone has got them all . Its as fast and beautiful as any top shelf device should be , but its polished . I just ca n't get over how well everything flows . No bugs or glitches . No app hangups or stutters . Its flawless after 5 days without a reboot . The verizon buttons are strange at first , but honestly i hardly use them for anything anyway .If you are like me and want a phone that can hold up to the demands of heavy daily use , hold a solid charge for 15 hours of abuse and do it gracefully then there is no other choice at this time . My screen is always on in my cubicle and i have 2030 left after 14 hrs . That s insane for a phone as slim as a razr with a full HD screen and LTE . This phone is untouchable by any other device . I was nervous because i never had an LG phone but I 'll besticking with these guys for a long while i think .	1
When I first got me Audi , even though it was n't from this location , my first service experience with this location was great . I was thoroughly impressed . However , my past experience this week has been the worst in customer service for a car . First , on Wednesday , I brought my car in and had to wait for a hour despite making it clear to everyone I came in contact with I just wanted to drop the car off and go . After 2 people being taken cared of who arrived at least 30 mins after me , another person , who was n't assigned to , noticed I had n't been taken cared of yet and was shocked to see me still waiting there . When I sat with AC Chan , who was assigned to my vehicle care , he never apologized for the wait or tried to make any accommodations for the wait . Despite knowing my car was going to be there for more than a day , never asked or offered a loaner . Never offered a drop or asked if I needed one . FYI , was always asked or offered when I came there in prior years . Next , I do n't hear back from anyone til Thursday . This time it 's a gentleman named Ronny who tells me that I need my ignition coil and spark plugs changed . Sprak plugs were changed just a week ago . I 'm paying 300 for a diagnostic . No reason they should be guessing what to do with my car . I say this to him and he 's like he will look back into that . No call Friday or Saturday . Monday , I get a call and I call back . ALL afternoon , I call a good 23 times and speak to no one . No one ever calls me back after each time I call . It 's now Tuesday . There is NO reason my car dropped off since Wednesday morning does n't have a diagnosis and still is n't fixed !	0

I ordered the Dockers Dark Marl Assort for my brother . Instead of one blue , one brown , and one gray he received black and two gray . So disappointed that the picture did n't match what was advertised . He also thought the length was too short . Unfortunately the description did not give the amount of inches , the way the Gold Toe description does , so again I took the length from the picture . He said he would keep them but not to order them again .	0
We put a 500 deposit on a car , unfortunately it did n't work out . After waiting days for a refund we were finally told that we would have to go there with the bank card in order to receive the refund . We went there and instead of a 500 refund we got a 500 charge . That 's 1 , 000 out of our bank account due to employee incompetence . We were told that the 1 , 000 has been refunded at it would take 23 business days to receive but the bank will have record of it immediately . We called the bank and there is no record of it . Called Poughkeepsie nissan and they say , you have to trust us . Come on . What ? ! You ca n't even be trusted to hit a refund button on a credit card machine . Thank you for completely screwing us .	0

Krill oil is a newly researched and excellent source of the very important Omega3 EFA . Benefits have been demonstrated for the cardiovascular and immune systems , for joint pain , eye and brain health , skin and hair beauty , mood and more . For those people who prefer to not use fish oil for either environmental or philosophical reasons and who find flax and borage oils to be too low potency and unstable they go rancid easily , krill is a great option . It is plentiful in the oceans of the world , contains astaxanthin a nutrient that is important in eye health and helps prevent sun damage to skin , and this brand provides a highpotency , very clean product . There is no fishy aftertaste or burping , although there is slight fishy odor when opening the bottle . The softgels are easy to take and provide a hefty 1000 mg , which is handy for minimizing the number of supplements one takes per day . I am impressed with the NutriGold quality , although I find the packaging to be ridiculously excessive each bottle comes in a huge cardboard box with a large paper catalogue .	1

The batteries , so far , seem to discharge at about the same rate as the OEM Samsung batteries . This is true whether the fun is idling as in overnight on the nightstand while I sleep or during the day while I am working and using the SGS 5 extensively .When I first purchased this kit I was using the battery charger extensively . It is somewhat slower than charging the phone using the Samsung wall charger / USB 3 .0 cable that came with the SGS 5 . Not a problem , this is probably safer for the battery . Now I use a different and much better system to charge my batteries .I purchased the Samsung Wireless Charging Back Cover and the Samsung Wireless Charging Pad and I could n't be happier . This system charges the battery seemingly as fast as the wall charger and so much easier . I just set the phone on the pad and within minutes the phone is fully charged . I have n't had to change batteries are open the charging flap on the phone since I received the wireless systemThis is great because I 've seen numerous reports of SGS 5 owners damaging their battery charging port covers and thereby ruin the watertight seal of the phone .	1

Had to change my review from 4 stars to 1 star . I ve had this case the screen protector on my phone since a couple days after i received it . The day before yesterday i dropped my phone , no biggie right . NOPE , i picked up my phone and the screen was shattered and my phone would not turn on . Its ruined so now i have to pay to get another phone , its disappointing cause i invested in this case knowing that otterbox 's are quality products or are suppose to be . I would like to return but i do nt know if i can without having the screen protector since i used it on the phone . If the seller could answer this question that 'd be great .	0
Do n't waste your money . Although the price is very tempting , you wo n't get anything for it .The protectors are so cheap that they become horribly scratched from nothing more than wiping it with a microfiber cloth a couple times . Could n't even get an hours use out of the things . Used three of the five that it comes with .Not worth it . Thankfully they are so cheap that it does n't really matter .Just a waste of time .	0

Went there for an oil change over the weekend and all went pretty well . They told me about a leaking valve cover that I ended up going back to get fixed yesterday as well , which probably ended up saving me a lot of money in the long run , so I give them the proper dues for that . However , this place is in serious need of training the staff in customer service . I was not called on Saturday when my car was finished , and when I ended up coming back 2 hours later which was the MAX time that the advisor told me it would be he said it was ready , but they had not done the complimentary car wash . I asked how long it would be for that to get done , and he was n't able to give me an answer , just stating that they had a lot of cars in front of me and they were short staffed since it was the weekend . As if they had no clue that a lot of people would probably prefer to get their cars serviced on the weekend . . . Then this morning I look and notice there was no indicator for what type of oil was used or when I would need to get another oil change . I decided to call in and find out , thinking it would take all of 5 mins at max . Unfortunately I was wrong . I ended up spending 15 mins on hold the first time , and then being hung up on . I called back again and was greeted by a receptionist who sounded annoyed that I would bother her again . She tried to put me in contact with the advisor I had yesterday not the same one I had when I got the oil change but said she had reached his voicemail and asked if he could call me back . When I asked her if there was nobody else that could look up the information for me , she said that only the service and scheduling center would be able to pull that information apparently Ashley was the only person in the service dept this morning , and she did n't want to transfer me to the scheduling department again since they had already hung up on me . I guess this is just normal practice there ? I asked her to please transfer me to the scheduling department , and I spoke with someone who told me that I did n't get a sticker indicator because I should just wait for the service engine light to come on . When I pushed back on that , she suggested that I speak with an advisor . . . So apparently the scheduling department ca n't look this information up , or she just decided that it was too much work to do that for me ? I still do n't have an answer because after another 10 mins of waiting on hold and then being hung up on , I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ? ! ? ! ? ! I 'm shocked that this simple request is so difficult to fulfill . Hopefully the location in North Raleigh is better because I definitely will not be coming back to you .	0

I have used this product for about 2 weeks and have noticed some improvement in my hair . I have always had thin hair , but as I 've aged 58 yrs old , it has gotten thinner and more sparse . Just this morning , I noticed that there is some new growth in what was an ever widening empty space . No improvement on my eyebrows , though . . . still pretty much nonexistent . For those people , like me , who are sensitive to certain additives the other ingredients are calcium , cellulose , stearic acid , silica , magnesium stearate , methylcellulose , cellulose gum , glycerin . I continue to look for a biotin supplement that is more in keeping with my desire for less additives , but will continue to use this in the meantime .063012 UpdateI've had to stop using it as it ended up giving me intense headaches . . . almost migraine in nature . I had to stay in my cave until it was flushed from my system which took almost 4 full days . At first I thought the headaches were from exposure to paint fumes . But , I went on an intense liver flush to detox my system and stopped everything except that program . The headaches went away . The first thing I started back on was the biotin and within 2 hrs , my head was pounding and the dizziness was back . So , I changed my rating to 1 star because that is the value it has for me .	0

First , the replacement blades are working just fine . My first set that came with my razor lasted 7 months . I have a very heavy beard . My biggest problem with this is that they could have done a better job with the directions .When you replace these take the time to really look at how the installed set sits in the top . The key to doing this easy is to understand that the black / grey spider web of plastic , that holds the three blades in place , is two parts . The trick is that you rotate the Black part to disengage the unit . The picture on the box does not mention this . They were smart to use two different colors on the plastic retention web but they were not smart enough to tell you this in the install directions . . . . . wait that 's right they did not bother to give us any install directions . Just three little pictures . Not enough .Just make sure that you see the two parts . . . . . larger part grey and top part black BEFORE you take it apart . Once you understand this the assembly was easy .BIG plus . . . . . . . this is on the Amazon subscribe and save program so you can save even more money it you sign up . I set mine to get a new set every 6 months now that I can see how a set of fresh blades is so crucial .	1

Clearly had a size Small purchased from my wish list , and I just received a size LARGE the other day .Considering they shipped from another country and how cheap they are , it 's not even worth it to try to send them back . I may contact them and ask if they 'll ship me another pair without sending the wrong ones back , but we 'll see .	0

when i click a movie , i already know i want to see it . . so i do n't want my first stop to be trailers and reviews . . . i want my first stop to be purchase tickets . . then , if i wna to check out trailers and reviews , that should be my second option . i find the site to be extremely circular and often have to poke around several times before i actuallt get to the window that allows me to simply buy tickets . i also find it extremely frustrating that when i do buy tickets for my local amc theater , i still have to go stand in line or at machine to get my tickets , insterad of simply printing out my tickets at home .	0

I purchased a preowned Mazda from this dealership at the end of January . The car seemed like it was in great shape inside and out but on the ride home I noticed a pretty major mechanical problem with the car that I had n't noticed during my test drive . I was annoyed but if you notice above I 'm giving this dealership a 5star review . Why ? Because they had an honest preowned limited warranty that came standard with all preowned cars and they fixed the issue free of charge to me . They even supplemented a loaner vehicle to me while mine was being repaired . All the while they kept me in the loop with timely updates and friendly service and now the car has been running great ever since . Tom Branco and Jay were both excellent workers here . I 'd recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a great , honest carbuying experience .	1
Product is a liar and a waste of money . No weight loss , no health benefits . Such a waste . And it always says 1day sale . Why ? Do they not understand what 1day means or is just this a hype to increase business . I will be seeking my money back .	0
I tried these , two packs , it did n't work . No affect all , for me . Save your money , and skip these .	0
I was looking forward to the arrival of this product . After the long wait for it to show up in my mail box I immediately opened it and my phone does nt fit . Its not tall enough and if it did fit the sides press on the volume and power buttons . I wasted money on this product .	0

I wanted an inexpensive sonicare but the brushing is so extreme that it pushed back my lower gum . It went back but this is the most abrasive tooth brush I 've encountered . I do not think I have sensitive teeth or gums , but my teeth felt like I was wearing down my gums after a few weeks . I do n't recommend this to anyone .	0
I figured I 'd give this a chance . It came in a D cup , it had pretty good reviews , so I could at least TRY the thing for a new tback summer dress I 'd purchased .Package came , first thought was ' that s not nude , that s a dark taupe color ' . So much for lighter or see thru dresses masking this thing .Followed instructions , tried the thing out . Looked in the mirror and laughed . What have I done to myself ? My poor breast tissue pulled away from their natural position to give a laughable amount of cleavage , while at the same time COMPLETELY UNSUPPORTED .Which brings me to my conclusion . If you have anything bigger than an A cup , do n't even bother . There is just no way this thing will give you any decent amount of support . I tried changing the position of the clasps and nothing helped .It 's just a all around terrible product for anyone with boobs .	0

My only complaint is that they are really warm . . .almost too warm sometimes . But GREAT for stepping outside to grab the paper . Very comfortable and true to size I bought the size 15 and they fit me well . I wear a size 15 narrow and was bummed they do n't offer it in a narrow , but it 's only a little lose having ordered the Medium width . They leather looks very nice and overall the shoe appears to have good fit and finishI'm very pleased with the purchase .EDITThese slippers started to fall apart within 30 days of use . The stitching started coming off and then the rubber started to peel back from the leather . By month 5 , the sole completely slit away from the slipper . In this price range I expect the slippers to go a few years , not 5 months of LIGHT usage around the house . I had to change my star ratting to 1 start because if a product does n't hold up , it 's useless how comfortable it is .	0
I was SO happy and psyched when I first ' discovered ' saw ad on internet this device on the marketplace ! I thought to myself , FINALLY a product that will enable ME to shave my hairy back , rather than have to beg my wife , or catch her at ' the right time ' . I drove quickly to my local retailer , and picked one up . You can not imagine the total dissapointment and frustration I had after trying this out , only to find out that it simply does NOT work well at all . My conventional AC powered hair clipper slices through my back hair ' like butter ' , but this joke of a clipper bogs down quickly the blades are way too small ! and does not handle hairy backs at all ! It can not shave off even a minimal amount of hair ! The product needs a SERIOUS REDESIGN . Perhaps they need to test it on amply hairy backs i .e . Italians , Greeks , Arabs , etc . . I am returning it for a refund first thing tomorrow .	0

Attempted to buy a vehicle on 3 separate occasions from Fields BWM and was unsuccessful due to such poor salesman and sales managers . My wife and I were basically kicked out our last visit , stating things are basically going to be sticker price for you guys .

This was an unbelievable experience for the positive . I had visited the dealership on Thurs , sept 18 . When I went , I had been approved by my bank so I had a certain amount in mind . I was looking at a 350z , but drove a Maxima and was sold . Unfortunately , there was n't one in my price range . I looked around at other dealerships and found one . But this is where my nightmare began . As I explained , I had all the financing taken care of . I explained this to my salesman . He can back stating that the bank was asking for something different than they told me . I went through three days of hassling because the car was in my price range . I finally said screw it . I called Jimmy and asked if they had a Maxima , black for this price . He said let me look , called me back and stated they did . I gave him the reference number to my bank , he called 15 minutes later with the exact deal I wanted and said the car will be ready in a bit . I showed up while we waited for finance , we laughed , joke , did final paperwork , and I was in and out of there in no time . I still have to take it to get buffed , but out of all the times I have bought a car , this was the best experience . Keep this sales model and you have a customer for life .	1

Today , we were humiliated by the staff members there we were dealing with . We purchased a CT hybrid there , 11 mo ago . We were contacted by our original sales agent , saying there was a good deal on the RC lease . We contacted them a few weeks prior to see if they could help lower our payment . We were met with an offer of almost 20k less than we paid for the car . I drive a Mercedes and the sales person insulted that brand . We were not happy and exchanged some words with herself and the management team . I have now reached out to the dealer manager . Bottom line , I 'm sure you could get better service ANYWHERE else ! ! ! My Mercedes dealer treats me with kindness and respect !	0

I had high hopes for this product . I have a stiff shoulder 3 months out from dislocating it and was hoping this would help . It did n't .For those of you that think you 'll escape reeking of the Ben Gay smell by getting a patch instead , you are sadly mistaken . I smell like an army of 1000 grizzled old men with arthritis and diyuhbeetus .You feel a little something , but it 's not pain relief . Maybe a tiny blunting , but then again you may be high on menthol fumes .	0

I thought MAXELL button batteries were a great value . The price and shipping on this product seem to change but seem to always work out to be around 20 cents per battery . However there is a reason why they are such a good price ! They do n't last .I bought these batteries for my old scientific calculator which requires 2 button batteries . The calculator was running on the original set of batteries for about 15 years .I installed two batteries on 7 / 6 / 12 . Originally , I was pleased with the batteries . However , this review is written 3 month later and I am no longer happy . I use the calculator once a month for 10 minutes or less balancing my check book when I do monthly bills . On 9 / 30 / 12 weekend I found that the calculator was dead . I always turn off the calculator , but even if I have forgotten it turns off automatically after 1 minute of nonuse . The batteries lasted 3 months , total of 3 uses , under 30 minutes of total active use . Since the previous set of batteries lasted for years , I can only give these batteries 1 star .Ali Julia review	0
for the price of this hoody i was actually surprised at the quality of this product . the inside is so nice and soft and feels super good on the skin . the outside looks great to and i woud expect this to last a while . i liked this so much i ended up getting all the other colors	1
I 'm baffled as to why this product has received so many favorable reviews . I found it extremely difficult to use , as it requires 2 hands . It also does a lousy job at clipping hairs , that is , unless you plan on spending an hour doing so . Although the battery operated models are n't much better , anything would be better than this . This is one of the few products that I 've ever purchased that was so bad , that I ended up throwing it in the garbage .	0

I usually write GLOWING reports for all thing Patty . . . unfortunately this is the first time I will be writing a bad review .

I had read so many favorable reviews about this inexpensive pair of pink freshwater pearl earrings that decided to get as a supplemental gift for my adult daughter 's birthday .They arrived with another box inside of a torn manilla envelope . The box to these seemed secure though . Upon opening , at first I thought an earring was missing . Turns out it was missing the post loose in the box . The other earring was a pearl with no stem attached ! Truly happy I did not send as a gift ! I understand they were only 10 .00 , but sending a completely broken pair is unacceptable .From what I could see , the pearl 's were not really pink or lusterous as advertised . Although I reordered , I 'm very upset at how they arrived about paying for return of the original broken pair .I have always counted on excellent customer service quality from Amazon on what they sell direct make choices about similiar items by the 34direct from Amazon34 or 34Amazon Curated34 guideline often . I 'll think twice about that now .	0

We were shopping for a X1 xDrive . An autobytel . com email linked us to a CPO 2017 X1 xDrive at Knauz BMW . I called Knauz from out of state and client advisor Brock Gordon took my call . I bought the car less than 24 hours later sightunseen using Brock Gordon as my eyesandears to give the car the thorough white glove inspection inside and out . Upon arrival at the dealership to take delivery , all was as stated and promised no surprises . Vehicle was as advertised nonsmoker , one owner , Carfax provided and as shown in all photos posted online . Brock Gordon was excellent through the entire process patient , informative , honest , thorough , attentive , and completely understood our concerns making a huge purchase sightunseen from outofstate with a dealership and personnel that we have never visited before . It could not have gone any smoother or better . Brock , and all the staff at Knauz BMW were great . Nice dealership and people . Would recommend to all looking for a relaxed , comfortable , nopressure atmosphere to ' kick the tires ' or make your BMW purchase .	1

I enjoy this lube . It is Very slick and lasts quite a while after your done doing what ever it is you where doing . It helps water proof your parts as well . all around good product . I will say that the seller duped me by not sending the pump with the bottle . It is impossible to hold any object made out of plastic or metal once you have gun oil on your hands therefor the pump would have been nice . since the picture shows a pump with the bottle I would have expected to get a pump . But the seller falsely advertised the product . so for that little devious act you get 1 star instead of 5 .On a little side note in a nonsexual , nonfreaky way , I put this product on my dry cracking feet and it turned my feet silky smooth it was awesome . The end .	0

Folks , if you do n't glean anything else from this review , know this Vitamin D3 is Cholecalciferol . This multi contains NO VITAMIN D3 . Vitamin D3 is the beneficial Vitamin D in which many people are critically deficient .The Ergocalciferol contained in this product is not Vitamin D3 . Ergocalciferol is something your body has to deal with , it 's overhead and not shown to provide the benefits of Vitamin D3 supplementation . If you 're interested in the rest of the story , you may want to visit the Vitamin D Council 's web site and / or Dr . Mercola 's web site .Your kids may like the taste of these as mine did , but it is n't worth it . Find somethings else .	0

XR650L they told me 4 time was 6 , 897 was listed on internet at 5478 . Four guys huddled in a room trying to find a way to screw me over . Low balled my trade in to the point that I saw red . Derrick had a big burly guy with him . . . hmm . . . I do n't blame him . When you insult a man that bad you need a bouncer beside you . Never again . Buyer beware . Anyone interested , try to buy their bike before they change the price from the internet . Never want to see you again Derrick .	0
I had an accident on my bike . We took it to Boswells to get repaired . They had the bike for over two months . When I got it back , they delivered it to my house in Donelson , I had to take it back the next day due to wires hanging down in the finder wells . They had it two more days to fix that . I work out of town and only home for a weekend every other month . My brother rides it home for me and parks it in my garage . I jump on it when I return from being out of town and go on a ride to Cross Plains , TN . While riding there the speed tach starts to jump up and down . Then when we arrive at our stop , my brother notices a large grove in my front tire . The wires they supposedly repaired was rubbing against my tire . Yes I could have had a bad accident due to this . We fix it the best we can and I ride straight back to Boswells and show Justin . He tells me he is getting tired of working on my bike and I tell him that I am getting tired of bringing it back . Needless to say I get a tire replaced and Justin tells me that it is nt their fault and makes me pay for my tire , costing me 350 . Not done yet , then a month later , the wires in my fender wells short out the switch . So I take it back again and this time Justin informs me that do nt do warranty work on repairs that they made , cost me 200 this time . Now three weeks ago I am still having trouble with the tach and the engine shutting off . This time I talk to the store manager and he tells me to bring it in and he will take care of it . I took that as he was finally going to honor the warranty of their initial work , no they charged me almost 500 to fix it . Do nt have any work completed at this place . They will lie to you and only want your money and absolutely o customer care .	0
First off , the case looks just like the picture and I received it within 3 days of ordering .However , it is very complicated to get on and the device can not be charged with this case on because the charger can not fit into the hole . So in order to charge the phone , I will have to take the case off every time and spend 30 minutes putting it back on .	0

If you are using starbright or instalight coals , STOP . Order these and write me a thank you letter . Spend the extra 2 minutes lighting these on the stove , well worth the wait .No coal taste , almost no ash , the little cubes burn for about 2 hours if smoked casually at a party , lots of passing .I will never go back to the other coals .	1

Poor Post Sale ServiceWhen I purchased the vehicle to help encourage the sale I was told about the lifetime free car washes . I relied on this information and cost savings in making my decision to purchase the vehicle . I was told by the general manager today that they no longer offer free car washes to existing customers . The GM acknowledged that he knew they offered free car washes at the time of sale but it was his decision not to continue to offer this service . This is the type of poor customer service the BMW dealer network is known for that gives the brand a bad reputation . If the dealer no longer wants to offer the service then they should appropriately compensate their customers for the loss in value for what the consumer bargained for at the time of sale . It 's poor experiences like this will likely lead me to not considering a BMW for next vehicle lease / purchase .	0

So I brought my car in for service yesterday . The problem is the radiator fan runs way too loud . My husband talked to the BMW mechanic before bringing it in and was told he 's 99 sure it 's the water pump . It happens all the time around 60k miles . That 's good news to me because the warranty I purchased from BMW covers the water pump . I was prepared to pay my deductible and have it replaced . Fast forward a few hours and the service advisor calls me and says my valve cover is cracked , need vanos solenoid , and other work to the tune of 4000 . 00 . Oh and there 's nothing wrong with the fan . I say I 'll come get my car . Long story short , they charge me 350 . 00 for diagnosis . Fixed nothing ! ! ! Fan is still running way too loud and my husband will replace for me which I should have done in the first place and saved almost 400 . 00 . I love my BMW and I HATE this dealership !	0
Resvaratrol is the ingredient in red wine that is supposed to be so good for your heart . Unfortunately , I neither like wine nor am able to drink it since I take so many medications with which it might interact . So this seems like an easy and relatively inexpensive way of getting my red wine heart benefits .Resvaratrol might also have other benefits it might help prevent insulin resistance , which is a percusor to diabetes . It might protect nerve cells from damage and from the buildup of plaque that can lead to Alzheimer 's disease . There is even the possibility that it might limit the spread of cancer cells still under study . But , even if none of these pan out , the heart benefit has been pretty well established and it 's a good thing .In the past , I have bought drugstore brands based on price but without any guarantees of quality or purity or potency . As I 'm getting older , I find that I am more interested in ensuring that the supplement I 'm taking is really providing the benefit I am counting on getting from it . I am impressed by the moneyback guarantee Nutrigold offers and prefer to spend a little more upfront if I have the confidence that the supplement I 'm taking is made by a responsible company who I can contact 18009731485 if I have any questions or problems .	1

I was cleaning the kitchen table with this , when my boyfriend said , What is that ? You 're spraying that where we eat ?

It has an Environmental Working Group rating of , A , and it costs pennies .	0

3 huge tablets a day ! What pregnant woman can take these ginormous pills , 3 tablets a day ? Plus , this product contains ginger . Ginger is rated as possibly safe and is used for morning sickness . If you have morning sickness , you ca n't swallow 3 large tablets a day , especially one like this with some of these stomach irritating ingredients . If you do n't have morning sickness and these would otherwise be a good choice for you , why would you want to expose your baby to something only possibly safe ? This product really makes no sense . It 's so disappointing because I loved the idea of organic , foodbased prenatal vitamins .	0

Gross incompetence does not fully describe the service screw up at Roseville BMW . When I picked up my Z4 two hours after it had been promised I noticed the front window and dash board were not cleaned . The service adviser was to busy to speak with me when I picked up the car . After arriving home and looking at the repair order for my oil change I noticed a comment rear tire very unsafe has cords showing and tire splitting . Then attached to the repair order was an analysis of various things on my car . Brake fluid needs immediate attention was checked . Both of these items should of been discussed prior to my driving away . Two hours later the service advisor called and could n't understand why I was unhappy about my experience . I will NEVER use these incompetent clowns again .	0
I choose this rating because that is how I feel about the product .I would recommend this product to anyone that need a phone case .	1

I do n't like to give bad reviews , but no amount of time and polite requests have resolved my several problems with Fields BMW of Lakeland . I paid for my 2017 certified BMW on Wednesday , July 12 , and drove it home . Fields was going to pick it up at 10 AM on Monday the 17th from my Tampa home and take it to Lakeland in order to apply Cilajet per Majed and Lanette install a full set of floormats per Majed provide a fresh Carfax report showing me as the first owner for resale value per Majed get a set of keys and cargo cover for my Volvo trade from the trunk of the BMW per Majed and provide a Navigation and Entertainment manual available for free from service centers per BMW owners manual . They forgot to pick up my car on the 17th until I reminded Majed two hours after the appointment time . The car was returned later that day with only the Cilajet coat applied . None of the other items were addressed . After talking to Majed on the phone , sending emails to him , and leaving phone messages for him , I got no response . I finally sent an email to the General Manager Gary Gordon who wrote nice responses to other online reviews , good or bad , and asked for his help getting the items addressed . No response from him either . The only communications I got from BMW were marketing emails to welcome me , congratulate me on my purchase , suggest I buy BMW services and apparel , and tell me how glad they were to do business with me . Looks like I am the fool here for ever dealing with Fields BMW of Lakeland . It wo n't happen again .	0

As with all Tide products this gets ground in dirt do n't I sound like an advertisement ? out of clothes and washes them cleaner than some other brands . What I like most about this Tide brand is the smell . The first time I used it I was thinking I 'd spilled a cleaner or something before I realized the odor was wafting out of the washing machine . The dryer also permeated the house with a fresh clean smell . What could be better than clean clothes and a clean smelling house ?	1

I am a workout junkie and I regularly listen to the music on my iPhone while exercising . Unfortunately , smartphones and other portable music players were not exactly designed with the exacting gym environment in mind , and I always fumble to keep my iPhone close to me while avoiding sweat and all the heavy objects that could damage it . Even the small dedicated 34waterproof34 pockets in many of the shorts that I use are far from ideal . In my experience a dedicated armband or a pouch is the best option for keeping your smartphone safe and accessible while working out .This is probably the most sophisticated and durable sports armband that I 've come across . The armband is thick and comfortable , and it grips your upper arm very securely . The smartphone pouch is very large , and can fit almost any smartphone on the market right now . I 've tested it with Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4S . The iPhone that I have actually has a very thick case that doubles as a wallet , and I was still able to put it in . This is probably one of the nicest things about this Avantree armband most armbands are designed with a single device in mind that can only fit in without the protective case . The smartphone case also houses an additional small pocket which can be used to keep a credit card / ID , some cash , keys , or the coiled up headphones when they are not in use . The protective screen is very well made , it 's sweatproof , and it allows you to still use the touchscreen of your phone . The bottom of the case has a small hidden opening that allows you to run the headphones cord through . In terms of its design , attention to details , and quality of materials this armband is second to none .Unfortunately , the fact that this armband is pretty large means that it is also quite bulky . This did n't bother me that much , and my running was not affected by it , but if you are of a slight build you might really notice the extra heft on your arm .I really like this armband and intend to use it as one of my primary gym accessory from now on . I would recommend it to anyone who does n't mind the extra bulk .	1

Horrible ethics and morals . Pedro Valverde is a desk guy that supposedly makes the deals . He came out and lied to myself and my pregnant wife of 9 months . We intended on purchasing the vehicle today after running all the numbers with him yesterday . When he came out he changed the numbers and tried to charge us 4000 more and thought we would not notice . After confronting him on it he claimed that his dealership needed to make more money on the deal and that I needed to get screwed in order to allow his numbers to be good . I would not recommend this dealership to anyone and I hope that management will take care of these issues .	0

They do not honor the Harvey employee pricing . Tried to sell me a new Titan for the same price as the online price . It should be 1500 under invoice not msrp plus incentives . I sent them the paperwork to back up what the Harvey pricing should be and was told that the employee pricing was more expensive than the online price . So basically anyone that was n't a victim gets it for the same price as someone who was a victim .	0

I 've had this cold for the last two weeks and have been taking Nyquil and Dayquil religiously to no avail . I keep waking up in the middle of the night with huge coughing fits but nothing seemed to work for the symptoms I have . I 've used Mucinex in the past for sinus problems and have had great results so even though this was pretty expensive I was willing to try it if it gave me results . Within two days my horrible coughing has almost subsided , with only a few coughs here and there . I did n't have any coughing fits in the middle of the night last night and the flavor strawberry does n't make me want to vomit like the taste of other cherry flavored cough medicines . I would highly recommend this for anyone who has a cough that just wo n't go away .	1
I do n't know how quickly this thing is supposed to work . But I have horrible left shoulder pain that 's been there for several months and appear to be related to join / tendon deterioration or damage . I 've taken this thing for about 2 weeks now and I really do not notice any difference in improvement . I do nt think it 's really doing much of anything . I expected a noticeable gradual improvement , but nothing . As a matter of fact , what seem to repair the damage / pain is just doing a tredmill circulatory high incline walk for 15 mins / day . If I had to do it again , i do n't think I would buy it again .	0
I 'd try one order and see how you tolerate it . Brite Eyes III irritates my eyes . Sometimes more than other times I ca n't figure out why . Today , I look like I 've been smoking something . You also want to rinse off what gets on the sensitive skin around the eyes after a bit . I use Brite Eyes III for beginning cataracts mild , just age related so I need an Nacetylcarnosine drops . I 've just completed week 3 . Also using on my dog Brite Eyes III is actually less expensive per ounce , if you check around for best prices , than Nacetylcarnosine drops made for animals ! You can find those online and in some pet stores . You can only get drops touted for human use , online from what I can see . I plan on seeing the eye doc in a few months . I have noticed perhaps my imagination ! less stars / flair around car lights at night while driving noticed that early on . I 'll be curious to see what the exam reveals , but that will be months from now . I hit 3 stars to try to be neutral for now . I 'll add an update but that wo n't be until after I get an independent assessment from the eye doc I had an exam , a couple months before starting the drops , that I can compare to . If no positive change , I 'll come back and give it 1 star . I should be able to see the changes in my old dog and took a photo I can compare to later .	0
These rings I bought 2 of the clear cz rings have been such an awesome addition to my ring collection ! I 've used them as ring guards for MULTIPLE different types of rings I have , and I 've also worn them alone , 2 stacked together . I have larger , longer fingers size 8 on left wedding ring finger and about size 8 .5 or 8 .75 on the right hand 34ring finger34 , and even with my hands / fingers , I could even wear just ONE of these rings and it would still stand out enough . I bought two rings in size 9 . I wish I had several more in varied sizes so that I could wear them on other fingers , too . These are VERY VERY sparkly rings ! ! 128522 . I 've had NO problems with any stones falling out , and I wear them every day regardless if what I 'm doing . The only time I 've taken themoff is when I 've put lotion on I HATE to get lotion on ANY of my rings ! ! . I TRY to remember to take them off when I shower . . . .but that only happens about 5075 of the time . Otherwise , I 'm worn them continuously for several months now about 34 months ? ? . Again , NO problems with stones falling out of these CLEAR cz rings . Can not say the same thing about the multicolored cz ring though , unfortunately . I 've lost SEVERAL stones out of the multicolored cz ring I bought and wore AFTER I bought the clear cz rings . Wonder why the difference . . . ? ? ? ? Anyway , both thumbs up on the clear cz ring . If anything , the size runs just a SMIDGE large . The size 9 on my right hand 34ring finger34 is slightly large . Probably need more like an 8 .5 or an 8 .75 . . . . . .but only comes in full sizes I think ! . Love my rings though ! !	1

I would not recommend this dealer to anyone unless you want to be without your vehicle for a week . I would rather drive the extra 34 miles to Austin to a bigger dealer where they said they could get me right in , but I know that 's not a very trusting statement from any dealer . I will not be bringing my vehicle there ever again , and probably cancel my warranty and just fix it myself next time , not worth the stress and headache to mess around with the dealers , as they think you can just wait how ever long it takes for your car to be fixed .	0
They 're cute , fun and exact knockoff 's of my Prada 's . Only difference is I do n't worry about losing these . What 's not to love ? !	1
This was by far the WORST experience i 've ever had with a car dealership . The initial salesman I had Javier was rude on the phone and then when i drove an hour to come see the inventory he passed me off to his manger bc he was too busy to help me . The the manger i forgot his first name but its starts with a C and his last name is Graham was extremely rude and short with me and would n't look me in the eye when i was talking to him . He also made me go outside and get my own VIN number and mileage off of my car while he sat inside and gossiped with the other salesman . He did n't even show me any of the inventory before starting the paperwork and when he brought the appraisal for my trade in I denied it because he obviously was trying to rip me off with the amount that he offered . I have an H3 with 80 K miles on it and he only offered me 8 K . I sold cars for 6 years , I know how much my car is worth at trade in value . DO NOT GO HERE . These guys are lazy crooks looking to screw you over to make a few extra bucks .	0

BEWARE I purchase a new Seadoo from this place . Paid cash for the jetski . The sale person was a nice guy but the service department and Mechanic sucks . These guys are not Technical . Service department Mike call me regarding a IBR recall update they wanted to proform on the ski . I advice the guy that my 1 year warranty was expired by a couple of months and I had concerns of making any updates to the ski . He assure me that any issue after the update they will fully cover and fix if it was cause by the update . Long story short they perform the update . My ski started having mechanical issue with the IBR system . Lost full functionality with the IBR system . The IBR error code light came on . Took the jetski back . They clear the error code . They told me some functions were removed by the manufacturer with the update . No problem . I got home and the IBR light came back on . I Call Mike told him the problem and he tells me he was going to look into it and he 'll call me back . Which he never called back . A week later I call him and he tell me that they do n't have time to addresss my problem . He told me to call the manufacturer that they are to busy to take the time to help me and do paper work , unless I pay them for the service . When I call Seadoo they told me I needed to go to the dealer and they need to open a service call . Mike told me that the manufacturer denied the repair . I call the manufacture and they said no one open a claim from CCC dealer . The manufacture advise me to take ski to a different dealer . So I decided to take it to Harbor Bay motors dealership . They diagnose the problem which was caused by the update . Seadoo agree to do the warranty repair . Repair was done in a day and my Jetski is back in the water with no issue . All the functions that the tech in Cross Country said was remove by Manufacture all came back once the repair was done at Harbor Bay motors . If I knew this was going to happen I would have never purchase my jetski from this dealer . They just lost a customer and Harbor Bay Motor gain a new one . which I end up purchasing a second ski from them on the same day of the repair . F Cross Country and the staff that turn their back on me .	0

Simple , nice protection . Lip comes up to protect front edges of phone unlike some others . Do n't buy it for the screen protector though , it 's too shiny and has a tacky feeling . Buy it for the case itself , which is great !	1
I waited anxiously for Otterbox to release this case and ordered mine within minutes of receiving the Defender Released email . I received the case on Friday and I must admit , it did not disappoint .First impressions The case is of great quality and a lot of detail went into making it compatible with all the OEM accessories . The holster is among the best I 've seen for a phone of this size and works perfectly with the case .After carrying it for two days and this is already my 3rd iPhone 4 case I am rough on my phones The case is without a doubt the most durable I 've seen for the iPhone 4 and lives up to the reputation that Otterbox has built over the years .Cons The case does add considerable bulk to the phone and may not be perfect for pocket carriers . It does include a holster which works great and can rotate for vertical or parallel carrying of the phone .Miscellaneous I have no complaints really , but I am left to wonder if the silicone flaps that cover the earphone and USB plugins could have been a little more userfriendly . Sometimes they are frustrating to get back into their proper closed position .Edited one month after using I am still extremely happy with the case . I have dropped my phones a few times already and though the case is starting to show signs the abuse I have provided it the phone still looks pristine ! I opened up the case this morning to clean the phone etc and to my surprise there was n't much to clean . With cases I 've owned in the past I would have a forest of lint , dust etc . that would trap itself between the case and the phone . The Otterbox has minimized that debris ! I am uploading several photos showing the difference between a bare iPhone 4 and an iPhone 4 in the Defender case so everyone can get an idea of how much protection and in turn bulk this case adds to the phone .Edited to add Amazon removed my pictures when the placed the phone back in a preorder status , I will reupload them again once they allow . I 'm not sure why they state preorder when it should state Backordered , will deliver in xx to xx weeks , but I digress .	1
This one I bought for a friend , she has the newest Samsung smart phone and the woman was dropping it . . . to much money for a phone to be doing that , I said I know how to fix the problem , went right to Amazon and their vast selections of cell phone products and bam her phone is safe from being dropped . . . Thanks Amazon , you are the best . . . . .	1

I purchased one dozen of these toe socks for a birthday party for teenage girls . That 's right folks , I paid almost 4039 .98 for a dozen pieces of junk ! One pair has holes all the way up one side , another pair , well , the stitching is coming out in the toes . I 've only closely checked two pair . . .wonder what is wrong with the rest of them . Do n't bother wasting your money on these Riverstone Goods toe socks . Now what to do to replace these and NO time to place an order for something else and get it here on time . UGH ! ! !	0
I just used my shoe this weekend and did a 45 minute walk / run on the treadmill . I was surprised that I did n't have any foot discomfort . Usually the first ten minutes on the treadmill is when my feet are on firepain pain and more pain . Then once my foot muscles and tendons have adjusted its okay . But I did n't have any pain with this shoe . I wonder if I can use it to play tennis ? I will definitely buy another pair of them !	1

I ordered two of these shirts . The colors are beautiful , and they fit well enough when you first put them on , but within half an hour they 're saggy and unflattering . You know how when you 're cleaning , by the end of the day you feel like your clothes look old and gross and worn ? It was like that only instead of cleaning , all it took was sitting down to read a book for thirty minutes . Went from Pretty and Feminine to Why Are You Wearing Your Grandma 's Shirt , You Look Frumpy just by virtue of being worn at all . Totally not worth it .UpdateWashed each shirt for the first time last night . Now they 're even baggier and the hems at the bottom are warped , floppy , and crinkly . Here 's hoping I can still return them .	0
I ordered this for my daughters Samsung Galaxy S3 I9300 she loves this case ! The card holders are perfect for credit cards and i d and the larger pocket holds bills , the case is very durable , so it protects if dropped ! The colors are beutiful and the case arrives exactly as shown in the image . I definately reccommend this case .	1

Bad customer service	0
If I could give less than 0 stars I would . Bunch of low life crooks . These dirtbag getovers would rather lose a valued customer than to admit to a simple error . A bogus report to the credit bureaus tarnishing my stellar credit score and a refusal to reverse with a simple letter of retraction . Great business practice Daniel DeGowin ! Quick background probably will take less time to write this than the letter Audi could have written to rectify . Was contacted by dealer to return my 2014 in March . Use this car as company vehicle , so payments autodeduct from company accounts payable Dept . Came in , dealt with Daniel DeGowin , made deal for 2018 . As part of deal , Daniel agreed to eat remaining 2 payments of my current lease . Left dealership . Follow up call from dealer indicated car was delayed as promised . In the interim , Audi reported nonpayment for two months that would otherwise roll into new lease . I picked up car shortly after , drove off lot . Made appropriate payments , set up autopay with new account , case closed . Now , in an effort to reverse an understandable error , GM refuses to write a letter for the adverse report to the credit bureaus . As a business owner , I pride myself in my stellar credit and rely on its perfection both personally and professionally . This was a simple error . I will be sure that not only will I never lease another Audi , I will make it my personal mission to ensure that the BBB , all social media outlets , the press , States Attorney , CFPB learn of the incredible lack of business integrity that Audi West Palm Beach , Daniel DeGowin , Chris Pimenta and Audi , USA , Inc . has for its customers . Best of luck if you go down this road . . . . you will undoubtedly need it ! There is a much better caliber of car dealership out there I , for one , will be driving a Mercedes from now on .	0

I bought a car from the lexus dealear a month ago and the saleman was very helpful nice guy and the front desk lady is also a very nice lady too that knows how to treat the costumers . . . now the problem i have is that i have n't recive my tags for my car now i m driving with an expired temporary tag because they do nt want to give me another temp tag . they have no clue about what s going on that they have nt recive my tags yet and i have been calling every week and ask them about the tags and they have nt find out NOTHING . . . and what really pissed me off and is the main reason why i m writing this review is that when they call THE MANEGER and i try to explain to him my situation and get an answer about why they ca n't give me another temp tag so i wo nt get pull over , or what been goin on that they have nt get my tags he just said to the front desk lady get his number and call him on monday . . . . DUDE I BEEN CALLING EVERY WEEK AND I GET NO ANSWER and walks away and ignores my claim . . . what kind of maneger is this i think he should really go back to school and get some education of how to treat customers . . . my son is 3 years old and has more education than him poor maneger at the rt 73 lexus dealer	0

So far this external battery pack has performed rather well . I use it on a Samsung Galaxy 3 and on a LG Flex . When the kids are watching videos on the phone on road trips , having a device like this is helpful in keeping the phone charged . We have also used it on an Apple mini iPad and it completely recharged it . We have n't used it to charge two devices at the same time , but that option is there if need be . Overall , for the price , I am impressed with the looks , quality and how it has held up to rigorous use . A 34must have34 for us now and it 's nice knowing that we do n't have to worry about plugging in somewhere or the phone going dead .	1
I have ordered screen protector for Samsung note 3 but the seller send me the wrong one . they hole from which you can listen os not matched to phone 's actual speakers .	0
First , in addition to the typical Amazon emails , I received a separate email from the seller Smooth Global . The email thanked me for my purchase , gave me great instructions for applying the screen protectors , and encouraged me to contact them if anything was amiss with my order . They also informed me they were shipping me an extra one because screen protectors are tricky to put on without any dust . This is fabulous customer service and it 's greatly appreciated .Second , the screen protectors . They are fairly standard , with the side 1 and side 2 labels . The screen protectors come with a cleaning cloth , installation card , and instructions . I did mess up the first one , but that was my own fault stupid dust particle . The screen protector was fairly easy to put on and it lines up perfectly , both with the sides of the iPhone , as well as the ends . The cutouts also line up perfectly . Once it 's on , it 's nearly invisible . The only way I can see that there 's a screen protector is at the cutout areas .All in all , exactly what I want from a screen protector . And with the great customer service , I 'll definitely be buying from Smooth Global again .UPDATE I received an email on 10 / 6 from Smooth Global that the screen protectors had a larger cutout than what was pictured on Amazon 's page . They offered to send replacement screen protectors at no cost . I soon received the new protectors with the smaller cutouts , which better protects the phone around the speaker camera at the top .First , the screen protectors are excellent . I have not been disappointed . Still nearly invisible , these protectors do exactly what I want protect the screen . Second , I was impressed that a company took the initiative to 1 admit there was a mistake , and 2 offer to fix it . And their followup was fantastic . After I received the replacements , I received another email just to confirm that I got the replacements and was satisfied . This dedication to customer service and timely response to any and all questions / comments has made me a loyal Smooth Global customer .	1

At the back of my mind , a childhood memory . . . actual PAPER straws , not plastic . How . . . normal . Easier on the tongue , somehow friendlier and more humanscaled . Easily worth the money !

These just FEEL so much more right than plastic straws .	1

Very sneaky dealership . People do n't even do your homework before coming to this dealer cause these people are highly trained to steal from you ! Your hard earn money ? These savages do not care about that ! They would make a deal with you and when it comes to paper work they will get you off guard ! And forget trade in value on your car ! Your car will be in excellent conditions and they will take advantage and give you thousands less on real book value . Ryan is sales is like the devil in a suit . Will make you feel like you are getting a deal of the century . Then when you are out those doors will lie about anything you guys dicussed . My Veihcle has damages to the hood of the car and they covered the damages with touch up paint ! ! Like really ? ? Then almost charged me for it when it came off ! . point to all this is they are crooks ! They sold me the car as new in all the paper work to get more money for the Veihcle and they are not making things right ! !	0

These fit well and are well made . I have worn two pair for 6 months or so and have had no problem . Lots of pockets . wallet pocket with button which i prefer over velcro . Traditional waste with no elastic with adequate belt loops . Overall , good quality .I think the twill Kingsize Mens Marine Cargo Shorts are a much better value 39 .95 w / free shipping vs 55 .00 w / 11 shipping both on Amazon . However there are some differences . The Lee has traditional belt loops and waiste . The Kingsize has elastic waste with loops . The Lees fall above the knees , where the Kingsize fall slightly below . I do n't have real strong feelings in this regard , so I favor the Kingsize for price . I have two pair of them as well .	1
I searched long a belt like this , the material is good and elegant , perfect for jeans . A recommendation Buy 4 numbers over whatever your regular size pants	1
I was looking for monthly magnetic memo pads to use in my kitchen for my grocery lists . The design on each of these is cute but these are very poorly made !

I bought one of these watches several years ago from another retailer . It 's a piece of junk , and the price on Amazon is about what it 's worth . When a watch says 100 M water resistant , you 'd think it would stand up to casual swimming . On my first pool outing , the crystal quickly fogged up with condensation . Realizing that a repair would easily cost me more than the value of the watch , I tossed the thing .I own several Casios , and find the brand to be generally wellmade I also own several Seikos and Citizens , all dive watches . But beware of the cheaper Casios , such as this thing . The cheaper models are pretty shaky .	0

This bra was AMAZING the one time I was able to wear it . Supported me through a highimpact workout like I had dipped my chest in carbonite , while still being comfortable . The double front is brilliant , allowing a really customized fit . Unfortunately , the second time I went to put it on , one of the plastic strap rings snapped , basically rendering this bra useless . Upon inspection , I noticed how thin and flimsy they are you would think , with a heavyduty control bra , Glamorise would use a sturdier ring . So disappointed ! I would have ordered several more of these , because it was amazing for that one workout .	0

The taste is n't awesome , but it 's not too bad either . It 's not bitter , just a little like sea weed flavor with a slightly gritty texture . Makes me feel very good in my gut with consistent use . I am doing many things for my health , so hard to zero in on precisely what 's responsible for the changes , but I think Green Vibrance is benefiting me . Over the course of 6 7 months I 've seen huge drops in my blood pressure , slight weight loss , increases in my energy , vision and digestive health . I put a scoop each of GV , unmodified potato starch feeds the good bugs , and spirulina in a 2 cup mason jar and put in my lunch box . In the mid afternoon I add 1 cup or more filtered water and chug a lug it . Watch out for green stuff on your nose and face !	1

This is a nice looking scale , but it is not consistent . You can get on the scale multiple times within a few minutes , and the display will give a different reading each time . There is no way to know which one is correct .I contacted Taylor and spoke with one of their reps . He had me remove the battery and reset the scale , but nothing has changed . He did say that the scale could vary two or three pounds , up or down , and that was acceptable . He advised not to get on the scale to weight more frequently than 15 minute intervals , as the scale needs time to reset . As for accuracy , he said I could compare my weight on the scale with my doctor 's scale , but that I could not expect this scale to be as accurate as a doctor 's scale .It took me days to reach someone in Taylor 's customer service , trying both by phone and email , and when I did , the rep was impatient and condescending . If I ever needed warranty work , I would hate to think of what I would have to go through and the type of service I would receive . My rating on the scale has now gone down to one , and that is only because it is a sharp looking scale that does not work very well .	0
Great experience , I spend 10 minutes digging through the powder , looking for a scoop ? It 's been what , 20 years since detergent manufacturers did n't include a 1 / 2 cent piece of plastic to measure ? So then I have to go online to figure out how much to use . First website a person says , I use a shot glass . Someone else , It recommends 1 / 3 of a cup . I do n't know where that is , there is no measurement recommended , anywhere it 's not on my container .Rule of business 1 make it easy to do business with you . Seventh Generation FAIL .	0

Honest , friendly and not pushy typical car sales at all . Facts are given and backed up with proof . So easy to work with and very accomodating . I highly recommend this dealership and salesperson Mark Rossi who helped us to get the car my son wanted so very much . We will definitley be back to again to Jim Hudosn Lexus !	1
Worse car buying experience ever ! ! I am SO sorry I went here . I bought a Volkswagen mini van here . Before I even got it home the check engine light came on . So much for their five point inspection for used vehicles . When I brought it back to get it fixed , it took 2 DAYS for them to even look at it and then over 2 weeks for them to get it fixed and for me to get it back . They claimed they would make it up to me since I had to pay over 500 for repairs , and that never happened . I did an on line survey . I received a voicemail message from Dave the next day so I returned his call . He was not there , so I left a message . I have not heard from him since . I was told again again that what happened is not Ziegler way . Ha ! It appears it is . I still have not heard from anyone and they never made it up to me , not even a free oil change offer or tank of gas for my trouble . I think I probably would have been treated better if I had bought a brand new Nissan instead of a used Volkswagen from there . Terrible customer service ! I would n't recommend this place if they were the last car dealership on Earth . The only good thing is that our salesman was nice and we were offered a loaner car while the repairs were being done .	0

Sorry , but I hated this product from the first taste of it . The grape itself is n't too bad but the artificial sweetener made me gag and the after taste is unbearable and lasts for a very long unpleasant time even after several glasses of water . This product is also loaded with caffeine thus the energy boasting , I ca n't tolerate caffeine and wish I had known it was in this stuff . It also did n't mix easily with cold water even though the scoop is very tiny it clumped and was difficult to swallow . I would not buy this product nor would I recommend anything with artificial sweetener and caffeine , not a healthy mix . I 'll stick to my unsweetened Biostack whey protein powder after workouts and let my workout be my energizer not caffeine !	0

This is the 3rd car I have purchased from the BMW Store and 2nd from Paul . Previously I had chosen cars from stock and I more or less settled from what happened to be available at the time . This time around , I started early enough before my lease was up to try and understand and compare the different models and options and get exactly what I wanted . Trying to understand all of this only by using the Build your BMW from the web site would have been next to impossible . Paul was invaluable in helping sift through all of the pros and cons with each model and especially the option packages . I test drove different models , each with various option packages . This helped me weed out the options that were not as important and , more importantly , helped solidify the options that were non negotiable . Paul offered recommendations when asked , but did not overtly push any option package over another . He seemed to understand what I wanted in the first place . He was patient with me during the process and there was no you have to buy now or this price is only good for today gimmicks that you might get elsewhere . The only slightly negative thing was that it took a month or so longer to get the car delivered from the factory than was indicated when I ordered it . I understand that this has nothing to do with the BMW Store or its staff . It was purely a manufacturing backlog issue with the BMW factory . Going forward and as long as I have the financial wherewithal , I plan on continuing getting my future BMWs from the BMW Store .	1

Before buying this swivel seat cushion , we were using the top part of a storage ottoman to give a little height to the seat to help dad maneuver his legs in and out of the car . This swivel cushion has made things much easier . The car we use has rather plushy seats so we use a 16 x 20 thick cutting board underneath the swivel seat to provide some more stability it also allows the seat to swivel more easily . I 'll soon replace the cutting board with another thick piece of wood or something because I need the board ! But the seat itself is helpful . It is good for short trips only , however . It is rather thin and can get uncomfortable over long trips . I am not discounting from the rating , however , because I do n't think that 's what it was designed for .Update Bought a second for my own car for spur of the moment trips . Cost is great and functionality is great he zips in and out of the car now and I have to keep up with him to bring him the chair out of the trunk . Good purchase , very pleased .	1

Where do I begin ? I dropped my bike off two Fridays ago to have the carb rejetted . My husband is a mechanic and very experienced one at that but we do have extremely busy schedules and thought hey , we 'll just let the professionals deal with it . We spoke with a group of 4 service techs and all agreed it was the carb . We then get a call the very next day from the tech Mark who was working on my bike saying the bike runs great and he thinks we might have a iginition module problem . Okay fine you 're the expert go ahead . Of course that part is double the price but whatever it needs to be done I guess . 1 week goes by and we hear nothing from Harley so I call , they tell me the part just came in on the late delivery and will be put in the next day . Few days go by and nothing so I call . I then speak to TJ our service writer who is now extremely rude ! He says it is a very involved job and they will call when its ready and hangs up on me ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! A few more days go by and I call back . Bike still not ready and my balance has gone from 275 to 590 . they had charged me for the original jet kit that was supposed to get put it but did nt . Which I already paid for , they charged me the labor to put the kit in and then tacked on over 100 more of misc . parts . Worst shop I 've ever expierenced ! Customer service is terrible , the techs clearly do not know what they are doing . The say the bike runs great . My bike runs worst then it did before it went to them ! My husband had to adjust the carb before even leaving the parking lot because the bike would n't even stay running ! ! The tech says that bike runs perfect . Like a brand new bike its a 883cc motor and he could barely get it to 80mpH ! ! ! I will NEVER return to this shop for any reason ! In the end I still had to pay over 400 for them to make my bike run like shit and it took them 3 weeks to do so !	0

After just 10 days the cord started coming out of the lighting connector . Then it would only charge when the cord was bent in a certain direction . And if it was in a certain direction , it would randomly go in and out . It also did say that it was n't supported . I 'm getting a replacement and will update this after a while and see how it works .UPDATEThe replacement cord looks better then the previous cord looked .

I have only used the product for a few days so far but it seems to have a longer battery life . I do nt think it has double the battery life of the original battery . If my original battery life had 56 hours of heavy use , the extended battery has around 89 hours of heavy use . When i say heavy use i mean 50 brightness watching netflix , youtube , playing games , and web browsing . Hopefully if this can last for several months i will change this to 5 stars .UPDATE 9 / 19 / 12Do not buy this product . The battery was fine for a 12 months . Now it does not charge through the phone . The phone says battery is not connected . I have tested the charging with my OEM battery and it works fine so its a battery thing . It charges through a external charger but now the charge wo nt hold and it drops from 10050 around 30 min . Also the customer service is horrible . I 've switched the Hyperion as they provide better customer service and they have a 90day warranty . QCell has no warranty which only shows how much confidence they have in their products .	0

I have bought the swiffer mops twice now . I thought the 2nd time around they had had time to make the product better , but it has n't changed . The pads are really easy to put on the mop , so it 's a good design . But I have to complain because the cleaning pads get a little pet hair on them , and after 10 seconds they do n't pick up any more lint or dirt off the floor . I have had problems with both the dry and wet mops . I have in the past bought microfiber cloths from the hardware store and used those on the mops with a little sprayed cleaner , and it seems to work better , but it seems like it 's easier for me to just mix up a bucket of cleaning solution , and mop the floor . Not sure why I even keep the Swiffer in the broom closet , I do not like the product , and it has n't changed at all since they first released the product ! They just do n't work with shedding pets !	0

I do n't know if it 's the 34Oaken34 or some of the other botanicals in this , or a combination of any of them , but this stuff is absolutely no good for me . I 'm attempting to clear up some skin ulcers that developed subsequent to eczemic outbreaks . The ulcers have serum scabs in them that the corticosteroid cream that fights the inflammation will NOT soften , even with Eurcerin Cregraveme in conjunction with it .I remembered a situation from about a decade ago when I developed such ulcers , but was hospitalized due to mistaking these horrid eczemic outbreaks for infection that would n't respond even to intravenous antibiotics . Such sores developed , and were managed with a wound gel . Whatever gel it was worked great , and the ulcers cleared quickly . But I ran out of the gel , could n't get the exact thing from a med supply house , and reluctantly decided on one that said it had vitamin E oil in it . Wrong . That 's usually soy bean oil but since the gel did n't name soy bean oil as an ingredient , I tried it . It was soy bean oil , alright . I broke out in hives , but knew immediately what it was . Prednisone and another , prescribed gel soon controlled the outbreak and sped the healing .I thought something in this might not be good for me , and it was n't . I returned it , earlier today . I 'm assuming the credit will be forthcoming just fine .	0

I read the reviews that said these pants would shrink , so I did not put them in the dryer . They were perfect length when I got them , but shrunk at least an inch or two just from being washed in warm / cold water . I dried them over the shower rod . Now they are too short . But they are still comfortable and warm . I hope they do n't keep shrinking .Edit They kept shrinking . Now down to one star . Not for tall people , unless you like cold ankles . They 're too warm for summer , so I 'm not sure if I will keep them .Edit I sent them back .	0

I got the Bounce Dryer Bar thinking it 'd make laundry one step shorter , and would keep me from running out of dryer sheets hey , it happens . Great in theory , not so much in practice partly due to the lack of foresight on my part .As a fabric softener , it works as intended . I ca n't fault it there . But as previous reviewers said it 's useless when it comes to removing static .Back to my lack of foresight My daughter has sensitive skin , so we need to use dye / scent free sheets . This bar , while removable , is affixed to the dryer . It 's not as easy as picking a different sheet from the shelf , there 's work involved . That right there takes away the only reason I got this one step shorter .So , if you just need your clothes softened and not staticfree or scent / dye / irritant free , this is your thing . If your situation is similar to mine , save your money .	0

My SO and I have used these cuffs about twenty times so far , and they have yet to show any signs of wear and tear on them . And this is with heavy , rough play , by the way .The velcro is awesome , but you CAN get out of these things if you work hard enough . Which I 'm not considering a con , it 's actually a good thing .When these are on your wrists , you can maneuver your fingers to unclip the hinge in the middle IF YOU NEED TO . You could also use your teeth I haveHowever , you 're not going to accidentally get out of these and they wo n't rip off .They're also sized nicely , and would fit around ankles and wrists on probably any body frame .The blindfold , is poor quality and sort of just an extra . We have n't used it because it 's so flimsy .	1
I brought my vehicle in to fix the wheel well flare and was told by Jake Brock it has never checked but I needed exhaust brackets and exhaust work costing 1300 . I asked if that was covered under my warranty he said NO but after pressed he said he do nt know and could not check . After asking him for a cost breakdown and description of the work to shop it around , I was told they will not have that until after the work was do . But he had the repair price ready for me . I will never will buy another vehicle at Hudson Nissan again ! ! ! !	0
I had very unpleasant burping with this product . I have tried a lot of different fish oils over the years and this one is at the bottom of the list as far as burping below even a cheap store brand that I bought once that did n't even claim to be burpless . I do n't have problems with most brands burpless or otherwise . I cut a capsule open to check out the contents and it really did n't smell that bad just like watered down sardine oil but it 's tough when it comes back . As an afterthought I now question their claims to be the 341 Ranked 34Best Omega 334 Brand34 . And why do they throw around Dr . Oz 's name so much he sure did n't recommend this brand .I will not be using this product again and would n't recommend it to anyone . There are a lot of much better choices available than this stuff .	0

Very disappointed with Fucillo Nissan . I dropped off my 2014 Xterra to have the serpentine belt , rear splashguardsmudflaps and one fog light replaced . I knew what work needed to be done , however , I still agreed to the diagnostic charge . The next day I was quoted 1010 . 00 for the repairs . You can see the attached photos for specifics but about 250 for the mudflaps including one hour of labor , 190 for the belt including one hour of labor and 520 for the fog light including 2 hours of labor . I purchased the same quality if not better parts on amazon for 140 dollars . The serpentine belt took me 20 min to put on two screws / clamps to remove one hose , push down on the tensioner and remove / replace the belt . The splashguards took 15 min3 Phillips head screws and two push pins that came the mudflaps . If that was n't bad enough , the fog light was n't even really broken but would have been just as simple a repair . The one set screw that held it in place along with two other interference slots / tabs had come loose and fallen out . I replaced the set screw in 15 min . What would have cost me over a thousand dollars at Fucillo ended up costing me 80 and less than an hour of my time . In the end , I guess I 'm even more upset at having to pay a diagnostic fee for repairs I TOLD THEM I wanted and in the end they did n't even properly diagnose the fog lights . I WANT the mechanics at Fucillo to make money . I WANT Fucillo to make money . I realize that businesses have overhead , taxes etc . . . but this gross overcharging and lack of attention to detail is sloppy at best , borderline criminal at worst . This is the second Nissan I have purchased and my ex wife has purchased or leased three . Seriously reconsidering another brand following this experience . I keep thinking about people that do n't have the wherewithal to understand what something should cost or the amount of time it would reasonably take to repair .	0

Both my partner and I purchased this product for our new HTC Evo 's and are very very satisfied . The audio quality is great . Voice and music comes in loud and clear . And when talking with each other on the phone the voice quality is better than when just using the phone by itself . It comes with 3 different sizes of soft silicon ear buds . I needed to change to the smaller size ones and it fits perfectly in my ears now . My partner uses the medium size ones that are on the headset and they stay in nicely . It even comes with a handy little clip to clip the wire to your clothing if you want to . . .and a soft pouch carrying case . Great price for what you get .	1

This order came on the same day I was having my first backyard BBQ of the season . I used this outdoors only so far , and it is really suited for heavy duty cleaning ! First , I found a plastic bin wide enough to place all the BBQ grill racks in and starting them soaking . I am a firm believer in letting the cleaner do the work .While the racks were soaking , I got the old push broom , softened from years of use , and I was able to pour the gel on the broom to wash dirt off the walls overhead . Not sure if I could do this with nongel cleaner .There was still gel on the broom , so I scrubbed the dirt off the cement around the table and grill .Back to the racks . . .with a bit of elbow grease , the baked oncacked on yech ! from last season scrubbed right away .I also like the smell of the product also . . .SoCal people , think purple Fabuloso , but not as harsh .I am a Vine reviewer , so I did not purchase this product , but I certainly will in the future . . .I'm a fan .	1

Unlike many thin screen protectors , the outer facing does n't have any clear protective film .When applying these , you can actually feel yourself pushing into the plastic as you smooth it with the squeegee . Despite my best attempt I did get a speck of dust trapped . I was able to peel back the protector , scrape the dust speck and put the protector back on . This did leave the corner where I peeled it up a bit disformed and it did n't stick 100 in that spot . So , if you have to do the same , my suggestion is to use something really thin to peel up the corner rather than using your fingernail .I really like that it includes a screen protector for the back of the phone , as I do n't always keep a case on mine . I also liked that they are somewhat repositionable .While they are gloss clear , they are n't crystal clear . I could see some color anamolies on a very small scale . They feel really good when using easy to swipe , and I did n't notice any negative effects of registering my touch .	1
I called wanting to buy a car . Was told to wait a week for it to be ready . Lined up a time to drive . The car was sold out front under me without giving me a chance to look at it . I even drove 2 hours up there before it was ready and was n't allowed to look at it !	0
This product provides a good combination of fiber sources and probiotics to keep the intestinal track flowing and healthy . It can be used any time but may be particularly helpful during dietary interventions or after the use of antibiotics to restore a healthy bacterial balance . Science has been discovering that healthy digestion is the secret to overall health .	1
Worked for 3 days then never worked again . Was very disappointed with this product . Would not recommend to anyone at all .	0

Very accurate . Worked well for me , gave me positive result 2 bright lines that could n't be mistaken and 24 hours later it was negative with only one line .I am not sure why some people left negative review , without taking into consideration that they might not ovulate that month , or maybe missed the window of high levels of hormones . For a very cheap price it gives you a chance to test twice a day every 12 hours I personaly refuse to pay high amount for the fancy tests with smily face , because these ones do the same great job .I would recommend it to eveyone .	1
I got a size bigger so that I could slip it on and off , Step Kick two three , and there it goes flying at the next person in front of me . Then I bought a black one for my darling , or he could 've had these blue ones , but it turns out they 're not big enough for him , so I get both of them . My darling has different shaped huge flipper feet , so it 's hard to surprise him with shoes , so good I have 2 colors for me .They're so comfortable , and do n't hurt my feet in certain places like my ankle , because I have an old wound there that will never go away . Plus if someone comes over like to deliver me more presents from amazon , I wo n't look stupid with barefoot , or dirty socks , or big flipper or wrong color sandals .I'm using them only for inside house projects and walking around , unless outside is completely dry and I do n't step in the muddy place , but inside for cozy computer Work and sitting with my Darling I 'll be wearing my Happy Feet Penguin Animal Slippers XL .	1
Taking off my shoes and slipping into comfy slippers is one of the little things in life I look forward to each day . Unfortunately , with these slippers , I am now dreading putting them on each evening . They were somewhat comfortable at first , but after two weeks of wear , the cushiony insole is all squished down , and not providing much cushion any more . But the worst thing about these slippers is the hard rubber sole which makes them extremely noisy when I walk on my hardwood and tile floors ! I usually get to bed at least an hour after my husband , and he has actually asked me to PLEASE go out and buy new slippers because I wake him up each time I walk through our bedroom ! ! Yes , I suppose you can wear them outside , but I have had other 34indoor / outdoor34 slippers which are n't as hard bottomed , and therefore do n't sound like I 'm walking around in tap shoes ! ! It may sound silly , but I just feel like part of the joy of slippers is to be able to quietly pad around the house . .not a concept in this pair .	0
5 stars i do n't think so , this app does nt have all the theaters in my area especially the one i go most often . guess they do n't pay for the service .	0
i am furious about the service and the experience with fandango and will never ever use them again . i will also adamantly go out of my way to discourage others considering using you all . my sister bought me a digital gift card and i have tried to use the gift code at two different theaters with the error code this code could not be applied to this order without even the courtesy to offer an explanation why . when i understandably want a real human answer , i try calling and can not get ahold of anyone . if you are experiencing an unusually high call volume you should ( pardon my french ) hire more fucking employees to handle that volume . and the estimated time is 10 min does n't really apply 30 minutes later ( no exaggeration , looking at my phone log now ) . i hope you all know that in a time where ticket sites are a dime a dozen , customer service and functionality are the only things that keep you afloat . good luck with your impending bankruptcy .	0

The projector was n't working when I opened it . So I smacked it on the counter Fonzie Style and it started working ! Then it worked for a couple nights . . . then stopped . When I smack it it works for a minute or two . Then one night it started flickering and freezing up . I 'm worried about a fire now , so we do n't use it at all anymore . Ugh . . . it is an AWESOME product when it works which is almost never .	0
I researched this product before I bought it and had high hopes . I already take collagen and thought this would be a good addition . During my research I did see allergic reactions mentioned on a few sites .Well I guess I 'm one of the few . After about 4 days I had a VERY itchy rash appear on my face and neck after taking my dose that day . It appeared in under an hour . I tried lotion thinking it was just dry skin at first , no effect . Tried cortisoze cream this ALWAYS should work NO EFFECT . Tried washing my face thinking it was just a contact allergy , nope . It finally went away later that day . This was SEVERE itch , like shingles or chicken pox .Suspecting this supplement I stopped cold turkey for two weeks and then took a dose today . Within a half hour I wanted to rip my hand and arm off they itched SOOO bad . Again nothing but time about an hour could make the rash go down .I plan on trying AGAIN in a few weeks to super duper make sure , but I have no doubt I 'll just itch again .	0
It is a bit clunky . .that is the bad news . All the rest is good .The phone is terrific as a phone . It has good clear sound , an easy interface , and helpful links to your contacts .The browswer feature is awesome . Edgeenabling means you have virtual 24 / 7 access to the internet , and to your email through the web or an Outlook style program .The 1 .3 MP camera is more than adequate for the opportunity shots when you do not have your camera handy .This is a far superior product to a Blackberry unless you need push . I do not , but I have heard push software can be downloaded .I have had Pocket PC 's in the past , and had no learning curve with the program . The reality is however it is quite userfriendly and takes little time to master .	1

This is my goto product for razor burns and other shaving / waxinginduced ingrown hairs / bumps . It only takes a little bit of the product to take care of it so well . Just a piece of advice do n't use directly after shaving / waxing , as it will irritate the skin . I use it after showering the day or two after shaving / waxing .Bottom line Definitely recommend !	1

The case fits nicely on an iPhone 5 . Unfortunately , after a couple of months of use , the rubberized coating wears off and it looks worn and dirty . Case Mate was nice enough to offer me a replacement , but I chose a refund instead .I got the Ringke SLIM case instead , and after 9 months of use , it is still looks like new . Overall , it is probably the best case I have ever owned for an iPhone or Blackberry even . It even has a place to use a tether great when outdoors or around water .	0
Worst dealership ! they care about you only the day you purchasing a car , but if you have a question or need support with service forget it ! DO NOT buy from ALBERT BAUMGARTNER !

I 've purchased similar bratops and I 've been disappointed by the quality , as they stretch out easily and do n't offer much support after a few washings . This bra seems to be an exception , as I 've washed it several times and it still fits very snugly and supports very well . It 's also MUCH more comfortable than traditional bras , and I 've found myself wearing this one exclusively , abandoning much more expensive bras that are now wasting space in my dresser drawers .	1
This is a good buy . I like to have extras for my phone and this set is still in use today . Good product for the price .	1

is the promo for the following link a joke ? https www . fandango . com promo bbyoblivion i purchased 4 movies from best buy yesterday with the ticket offer for oblivion and today after i entered the codes on the promo page and logged in , i was asked to pick a theater showtime then enter my credit card info and pay full ticket price plus a surcharge for your service . nowhere did it mention the promo after i logged in . is this really just a bullshit offer to get people on your website , or do you make it so hard to do this that most people give up like i did ? sincerely , jason mcghee p . s . trying to submit an email about this problem is just as difficult as it was trying to redeem the tickets .	0

I 'm a bit stunned by these reviews . If you buy a Merkur Razor , this is possibly the worst choice in a blade . They are incredibly expensive , dull quickly , and provide a rather rough shave .If you are using a Merkur blade as your first DE blade , maybe you think it 's great , but there are so many better choices that are a fraction of the cost .Please get a sampler pack of blades when you get your first DE razor . Derby , Gillette 7 O'Clock , Israeli Personna , and even WalMart blades are a much better choice . These are terrible . I buy my favorite blade Israeli Personna for about 10 cents a blade with shipping . Derbys are pretty good too , at about 13 cents a blade .	0

After reading the reviews I bought this and it did not meet my expectations . The pill holder was difficult to open as others have also stated . I thought it would hold more than it did .

I brought my car in to have the rear sun visor motor replaced . While my car was at the dealership , hurricane Harvey hit .

I purchased this to use with my elongated toilet . Anticipating knee replacement surgery I was unsure if I would need it or not . I also knew I wanted something that was easy off so others would not have to use it . I tried this a few days before surgery and was totally disappointed in this product . The advertisement indicated it was for regular or elongated toilets but it really does n't work on an elongated toilet . The hole is too small to be able to clean yourself and it is very unsteady . We kept it just in case but after surgery I found I did not need it so we threw it out . I would never recommend this for an elongated toilet as it is very unstable .	0

I currently own four iPhone 5 's and previously owned four iPhone 4s . 2 of my 4 old iphone 4s top buttons stopped functioning . They had been pressed too hard for too long . It got jammed in . The other 2 phones had covers that were exposed . No issues with those 2 . My guess is there will be a big lawsuit from a law firm soon against Otto / Incipio on their design . Here I am , thinking I 'm buying a great cover / protector of my iphone . And then it actually damages the phone ! I would rather have an iphone with scratches and a cracked screen that works ! I thought it would be improved with these . But you still have to press hard too hard . Trust me , go with the cover with that has all buttons exposed or go with no cover at all Go commando lol . Go with wireless carrier insurance if you have too or just keep your old phones for insurance .	0
I 've never had to wait this long for simple servcies . My first experience was an oil change that took almost 4 hours and the service rep never told the shuttle driver to come get me after I phoned in requesting a pickup . My second experience was a check engine light . I dropped my car off at noon and was told they should get to it by the evening . 530pm rolls around and no phone call or anything . I 'm left carless . I call back the next morning . They still had n't looked at my car . Over 24 hrs pass and still nobody had even looked at my car even though I had an appointment . No warning or anything that I 'd be carless .	0

Left terrible white streaks all over my clothes ! I followed the instructions , and placed the pod on top of my clothes at the beginning of the wash . All of my black cotton slacks are covered in white streaks . These are strong , heavy , bright white streaks , not just little , barely noticable ones . There is white residue built up along the seams and the belt loops . I had to wash the entire load all over again . I ca n't even look past that to tell if they softened my clothes . They do n't smell like orange , they do n't smell like anything . I actually like that about them , however , not enough to give this product more then 1 star . If I could give it 0 stars , I would . I wo n't be buying or using these again ! I have tossed them in the trash .	0

Just in case a piece of gear could ever approximate fingers , or deep tissue massage , and at the price , it was worth a try . This thing is just amazing .I am a big person , 6 ' 4 at 260 pounds and it just churns away without any struggle , grinding or whining , nothing to indicate it 's having any trouble with my neck .My wife and daughter ca n't use it . It does n't get their necks .But for me , it 's a treasure and here 's why .You can set it to massage DOWN your neck , or UP your neck .When you have it working UP your neck , you can turn if OFF right at the point where it 's pulling up on your neck just right for a little traction and the two fingers just hold your head there ahhhh relieving distraction of compressed cervical neck vertebrae .Or you can just lay there and it will churn up or down your neck and you will not want to get up . So do n't .Finally , you should know that if you do n't lay straight , and or if your neck is n't straight in it , and this is only sort of funny when it 's churning UP your neck it bobbles your head side to side a little . So patience to get your head in there straight and it does n't bobble your head .VERY comfortable , very effective , strong on big necks , but NOT for little necks .	1

We walked away from our first meeting confused about who was selling us a car , DeRonn or Aaron . After arriving at a verbal agreement over the phone , we made a second trip out to close a deal but the games continued . In the end , the staff tried to pull yet another fast one . They were dishonest and wasted an incredible amount of our time . We walked away again and are happy to spend our money somewhere else . I will not hesitate to tell anyone and everyone what a lousy experience we had at Jeff Wyler . Take my advice , this dealership is an absolute joke . Their clumsy sales tactics were comical . They tried to utilize so many the old bait and switch , funny math , announcing a sales training in the middle of our original meeting , crafting a monthly price based on my needs as if they care as opposed to discussing the ACTUAL price of the car , eavesdropping , good cop / bad cop , talking to the manager and then that manager 's manager . . . all high pressure sales tactics that expose total disregard for the customer as a person , let alone their intelligence . I am convinced all they saw when I walked in the door was a bank note . They 're a train wreck . I think my favorite memory and one I can only laugh out loud about was when DeRonn suckered me into shaking his hand and then declared we had a deal but then disappeared when the actual moment for one presented itself . Do n't waste your time or money with these clowns or the joke will be on you !	0

Philips Norelco PQ208 / 40 Travel Electric RazorI bought this shaver because I stupidly broke my Remington while trying to clean it . I saw shavers with much better reviews than for this Philips Norelco , but I could n't see spending the prices they demanded . Anyway , after trying this shaveronce was enoughI came back to Amazon looking for a shaver that would shave this Norelco definitely does n't . Anyway , I had decided upon a 40 Remington because it had NO one or twostar reviews , but I first tried once again to fix my broken Remington . This time I succeeded in fixing it , and now I 'll probably be using this Norelco for a paper weight . I might add that I 'm seventysix , and I have have owned many electric shavers in my life , but I never found a Norelco that was satisfactory . Remingtons yes , but Norelcos no . That may be simply a matter of personal preference , but that 's been my experience . Anyway , I was unable to get a good shave with this Philips Norelco . I might have , if I had persisted , but my face was starting to feel raw , so I did n't want to continue .	0
we believe your website works backwards in determining which movie we are going to see . it makes it more difficult to enter the site completely to find out that there are n't many seats left for that showing , then having to back out to start again . it should be the other way around . we should be able to pick our movie , then select the showtime we most want . that window should open up to the floor diagram showing which seats are available . if we like what 's left , we continue , if we do n't see a seat we like , we select the next preferable showtime and see it 's seat diagram . this allows for a more fluid show selection , which is how most people choose the showtime they want . also , why ca n't i input my cinebistro gift card into the available box that asks for it i must call and have the front desk apply it . . . very frustrating ! ! !	0

very upset that i bought my daughter and her boyfriend a gift card to go to the movies and they had to add 70 cents from their credit card on . you guys knowing what the cost of a movie is should not have a service charge that goes over the amount of the gift card is you 're allowed to buy ! very dissapointed !	0

I have several of these . I also have lots of bluetooth headsets . For those times where I can live with a wired headset which is most of the time I use this one . You can sit in a crowded restaurant and the person you are talking to thinks you are alone in a quiet office .Brilliant design that every phone maker should license and build in to their handsets .It has two microphones , one facing your mouth and one facing out . They are crossconnected so any sound that comes through both sides is cancelled . Only sound coming from your mouth is picked up .Stays in your ear without the loop , and seals the ear canal so well that I actually have to turn DOWN my volume .The earpiece is the same as the Shure e2c consumergrade inear monitor which I also own . So you are essentially getting 1 / 2 of a 100 inear monitor for your phone . That means excellent sound quality . When combined with the best noise cancelling I 've ever used , I can say that this is the best kept secret in telephony .I use this on my cell phone and on my landline phones . No one ever knows where I am or what kind of phone I 'm on .Highly recommended . . .	1

When I originally decided to make the switch from Blackberry to Android , I did a great deal of research into the whole Android platform , what 's good bad and did all I could to be entirely ready for the whole new learning curve that a brand new OS usually brings . My plan was to hit the ground running and be as proficient as possible with my new phone by the end of the first day . . .and THIS is where I ran into my first speedbump . I went to literally a dozen stores hoping to get an X only to find they were all outofstock and the back order was 36 weeks . This of course was my own fault for not making the leap when the X first came out . No , I waited a while and found they were totally out everywhere I looked . So I ordered one anyway , and waited . And waited . Week after week I waited . I finally lost my patience partially because I was going to give my wife my BB Tour and she was quite interested in trading up seeing as her old Curve was in dire straights and we were n't sure how long it 'd last and just went in and ordered the Incredible .I was initially VERY impressed see my review with the Incredible . Unfortunately the sales rep told me a few things in order to get a sale from me that turned out to be entirely false . Namely that the DInc had the same preinstalled SD card as the Xit does not . Oh , and she also said that the 2 .2 Froyo update was already done and ON the phoneit was not . This wasIMOa blatant lie in order to secure a sale . Had I been working with just a regular sales rep at the Verizon store I went to I suppose I could forgive an honest mistake , but this was the Manager , and this kind of mistake was almost certainly an intentional one . I bit my tongue , however and moved on . After a few days decided that I just wanted the bigger screen and came backto the same Managerand informed her I would like to use my 30day tradein option . Once again , there was NO X in stock and they really could n't tell me when another would be coming in . I began to get discouraged but a funny thing began to happen literally the moment I began to seriously consider keeping the DInc I began to really like the phone . . .a lot .After a couple weeks I woke up and found the OTA Froyo update was waiting for me to activate . Initially I was VERY excited knowing the phone improvements would make it even better . I noticed better battery life improved by about 1520but keep in mind the DInc 's battery woes were abysmal to begin with and improved web loading . What I DIDN'T initially figure out was with the update came a few new widgets that would spontaneously start up regardless of how often you used the Task Killer to closeor even by Force Closing it using the Manage Application function . I would routinely check my Auto Task Killer and notice City ID , Skype and a few others almost ALWAYS on and running . I do not use at least not at the moment ANY of these apps and yet they would autostart ALL the time . This infuriated me until I read on dozens of forums how using an app like Auto Task Killer are not really all that necessary because Android is designed to manage most of those functions all by itself . I DO use a Task Killer , but only to exit from the Internet and manually close some of the apps I use now then and just leave the rest alone . I set the ATK to ignore certain apps and discovered my phone STILL worked fine and I noticed absolutely ZERO lag time or issues with the phone slowing down with some of those programs running quietly in the background . Face it , unless you physically open Skype , or City ID and tell it to DO something , it really is n't using up any memory . For those who are absolutely anal about shutting off absolutely everything using a Task Killer , look around on the ' net and read some of the forumsespecially those from Android developersand see if this is n't true .Right at the point when I was accepting the fact that my DInc was forever going to be mine , I got the call that an X had showed up . I rushed over , made the trade and I wake up the next day with mixed emotions . I had really grown accustomed to the HTC Sense UI and I got ta say , that overall it was a MUCH more polished and better all around LOOKING system than what I now have with the X . That does not mean I do n't like my X , though . They are just two very different phones using a variation of the exact same OS . One just happens to be more polished than the other . I have noticed that the screen is just amazing on the X . Bright and obviously huge . . .but not TOO big . The X has a few more pixels than the DInc does , but since one has a smaller screen , the density is greater and therefore the Amoled screen on the Incredible also looks brilliant and very vibrant . One thing that hampers the DInc in a VERY serious way was the ability to read it in direct sunlight . I had read all over that this was a major problem , but dismissed it because I rarely used my phone that wayor so I thought . It was amazing how often I did , and boy did it suck under those circumstances . The X on the other hand was much easier in sunlight to see and read . Point goes to the X on this one .One place I noticed another difference was in swiping the Main screen to the adjacent screens is more responsive on the Incredible and I have found several times that the X takes several seconds to even register that I tried to go from the Home screen to one on either side . This puzzles me because they are both comparable in every wayeven down to the 1 gig processor . . .so why the lag time ? Oh well . After using 2 .2 on my phone for a few weeks I now am back to 2 .1 Eclair on my X , so that too is a small step backwards . It 'll come , eventually so I 'm not too worried .I absolutely LOVE Swype . The X comes with it right out of the box , but I really had to look for it for my DInc . The Beta trial had ended at the Swype homepage , so I looked and looked and even downloaded a VERY similar app called SlideIT which worked greatbut after a few days it too ended because it was just a trial version and finally found Swype for free . I have noticed ONE thing that the version on my X had that was n't on the version I downloaded to my Incredible was the microphone option for times when I do n't want to use my fingers and just speak out what I wish to text a progam which is absolutely freakin ' amazing , btw , there IS one on the Swype keyboard on the X . . .but I had to change out the keyboard to the original on the DInc in order to use that function . It was a bit annoying , but did n't really bother me . Its nice to see it included here .I also kind of miss the buttons along the bottom of the DInc along with its optical trackpad . The physical buttons on the X seem quite a bit differentand not in a good waythan what the Incredible had . Just more responsive on the Incredible . I miss them more each day . . .again , oh well . There are several reasons why you may like one phone over another , and this is also one of the reasons why I believe Android will eventually really eat into iPhone sales diversity . HTC makes Android phones , and so does Motorola Samsung just to name a few . Each company have placed their own unique version of Android on their phones , some are better than others , some have options the others do not but its the options that make the platform so amazing . If I hate ATT and I DO , with a passion . . . but still want the iPhone on TMobile . . .I'm SOL . However I get plenty of options if I want an Android phone , because they have at least ONE model on each and every carrier in the US more depending on which provider you may have . Being able to customize your phone , having the TRUE ability to multitask with a Droid versus what iPhone passes off as multitasking and ONLY with the most recent versionif I am not mistaken is just SOME of the reasons why this platform will not only work , but thrive . For those who are insistent that iPhones are better I say this honestly , its just a matter of opinion at this point . If I had an option to get an iPhone on Verizon , I really might get one . I think iPhones are awesome their reception issues notwithstanding , but there are things you can do with Android you simply ca n't do with the iPhone and viceversa . The app market for BOTH platforms are SO huge now that it really does n't matter which phone you get , there are more apps than you will EVER need and all the good ones developed for the iPhone have a counterpart for Android , too so that point is essentially moot . If you are willing to accept ATT 's absolutely horrific socalled nationwide service , be my guest . Having had such a terrible experience with their service with my BB Bold in my particular area pretty much soured me on them for good . . .however YOU may get fantastic service where YOU live , so again , its a matter of preference .Undoubtedly I will make some updates in the coming days and weeks as my experience continues to grow . . . .but I also feel compelled to note that the biggest problem with Android thus far is how amazing they are and how much fun they are to play with can seriously eat into your productivity at workIF you let it . Keep that in mind and come back soon and see what else I felt important to add to my review . Oh , and thank you for reading .UPDATE 1Battery life on the X is definitely better than on the Incredible . I 'd say roughly 3040 better . . .and considering how massive the screen is , that is saying something .I have noticed an ENORMOUS difference in switching from the Incredible to the X while browsing the internet . I guess you do n't really know or appreciate how much different and better the experience is as a whole with Froyo 2 .2 than with 2 .1 until you use one for a few weeks and then switch to the other . HTC put Flash Lite on the Inredible even without 2 .2 , but WITH Froyo , the internet really IS dramatically improvedseriously . I did n't quite realize it until I went surfing around yesterday and discovered a WORLD of difference . For those iPhone users who balk at not having Flash and according to Steve Jobs , never WILL as not decreasing your overall internet viewing experience . . .you are 100 deluded . The difference is simply amazing . I suppose if you 've never trolled around the ' net using a phone that was Flash capable you do n't really realize what you 're missing , but TRUST me , you are . My Incredible had a setting which allowed me to view websites in mobile phone mode , or view them as I would on my desktop computer . So far I have not found this option on the X . I just may download Skyfire until my 2 .2 update arrives , I have n't decided just yet .I really like being able to resize widgets on any of my 7 screens . I wish I could resize them to whatever size I wanted , but they are predetermined and some wo n't resize at allbut having SOME options is better than none , right ? I got ta say I really miss the stock HTC calendar that came with the Incredible . I have tried locating another version online and at the app Market that can compete , but so far I 'm coming up empty .The alert light at the top of the screen just to the Left of the speaker is MUCH easier to see than the ridiculously microscopic light that the Incredible employed . It was VERY difficult to see , even when looking almost directly AT the phone face . . .if it was turned only slightly one way it simply did not register to the human eye . I am very happy with this improvement on the X . One option that the X has that the DInc did n't was being able to make the alert light blink in different colors . Hey , I 'm just glad I can SEE the darned thing , but having this new option is downright awesome .The X camera is on par with the DInc 's . . .which is to say that as long as you have decent light , the photos ROCK . . .if you are indoors , with even minor lowlight conditions , the photos come out amazingly grainy . I can see a daynot too far off eitherwhere phone cameras will entirely replace regular digital cameras , but so far today is NOT that day . Have n't fiddled with the HD video capabilities much , but I 'll post an update about that soon .As much as I hate to admit this , I now almostALMOST believe the phone is too big . If I had purchased the X before having the DInc I am positive I would n't be having this issue , but going from one to the other is quite dramatic . I now think that a 4 inch screen is probably an ideal middle ground between too small and too large . I still love the gorgeous crisp and colorful screen of the X , but after becoming SO used to the Incredible 's size , it almost feels like I 'm trying to walk around with an iPad in my pocket . Again , I doubt this would 've been an issue had I not gone with the DInc first . . .and the issue is minor at best , but if I 'm honest , it IS a factornot a big one , but one nevertheless .UPDATE 2I am VERY impressed with the camera function of the DXespecially in comparison with the 8MP camera on the DInc . . .mostly because the Incredible 's camera was just plain SLOW . Even WITH a 1 gig processor , it seemed to take way too long for the camera app to load properly . Once deployed , the moment you wished to capture just may have been lostand if that was n't enough , once you tried to actually snap the pic , it seemed to take forever before the shutter eventually snapped . My 7 year old Palm Treo 650 was faster , by a pretty large margin , too . Granted , I realize the Treo could only do a fraction of what todays phones are capable of , but you got ta realize in terms of technology , 7 years ago was practically the stoneage when it comes to how far things have progressed . The reason why this is interesting is because just yesterday I was reading an online review which compared the X with the Incredible and one place where the DInc beat the X was with the camera . According to the review , the exact opposite happened than what I had personally experienced . The X was slow to snap pics and the DInc was much faster . I find this very bothersome because with the exact same phones we are seeing totally different results , and I have to wonder why . Also , photos that I have uploaded to Facebook do so MUCH quicker with the DX than with the DInc . . .even AFTER it had upgraded to Froyo still waitin ' on that 2 .2 update for the X btw . . . .On the flipside . . .the speakerphone for the X is abysmal . The Incredible 's speaker was light years ahead and 34 TIMES louder . Granted I do n't use it that often , but with a phone this big , I just naturally assumed the speaker would be AS big , too . . .not so . For my money , the best speakerphone I have ever heard on a cell phone came from my old original Blackberry Bold . Now THAT was a great speaker . Even my workissued older BB Curve has a much louder speaker . I 'm a bit surprised here at why this one thing has been neglected by Motorola , but it is n't by any means a dealbreakerhowever , if YOU require a very loud speaker for your phone , I would seriously think twice . Check one out in person before making any purchase at the very least .I discoveredquite by accident and very embarassingly sothat when you place your phone on Vibrate , that incoming email notifications may STILL make an audible reception notification . This happened to me yesterday while teaching a lesson in Church . Not exactly the kind of place you want to discover that your phone is n't entirely in the ' Silent ' mode . However , now that I have found this out , I have to wonder why , when you place the phone on Vibrate this can still happen ? I really DO like options , however this is one place I would rather prefer it to be really simple when I put the phone on silent , I want the ENTIRE fuction of the phone to be silent . Is that too much to ask for ? Just sayin ' . . .UPDATE 3While doing a sales call to a local Sprint store yesterday , I noticed that the display model HTC Evo was running 2 .2 , so on a whim I went out and checked if any updates were waiting you have to manually check for them on the X while on the Incredible I woke up and it showed on the home screen a notice that an update was ready to download and sure 'nuff , there it was , ready to go . It took maybe 20 minutes to download and completely update , which was nice seeing as it was in the middle of my work day and I really ca n't go without being able to use my phone for too long .The update changed the way the screen looks when I initially turn it on , a few small cosmetic changes have been noticed in the calendar function , tooall for the better . I did notice that my Swype screen keyboard looks almost 100 different . . .but that was mostly in color changealthough why they felt the need to alter that I have no clue , it looked fine beforebut oh well . Flash is now on and running . . .however I have noticed that even though I discovered how to tweak the internet settings in order to view webpages as they normally appear on my desktop instead of on mobile settings NOT a simple fix , mind you , many websites STILL render on my X with the mobile page version , which bugs the crap outta me . The Incredible did not have this issue . I have since gone back to see if my original setting did not save , and found out that it in fact HAD . So WHY is it that some webpages will not render normally ? ? Especially now that I have Flash I feel as though I am missing out on a cleaner more full internet experience than what I had with the DInc . Just a bit frustrating if you want to know the truth .Also on a whim , I decided to see if I could download a copy of a movie I had on my home computer . It took a bit to figure it out , but it loaded fairly quickly , and within 10 minutes I was watching Iron Man in the palm of my hand . I got ta say that was pretty dang sweet . The picture quality was awesome and it rendered on my screen beautifully . Well done Motorola .On a side note , I wish to further moan about the 4 physical buttons at the bottom of the screen I do NOT like them at all . Now I realize this is entirely a personal issue , because I have noticed many who reviewed the Incredible did not like its touchsensitive buttons . . .but I have to say that having had and used the X now for over a week that I really miss the design of those buttons on the DInc . Also , as much as I was n't initially a fan of the optical track pad on the DInc , not having one on the X highlights a problem that one will not have a problem with on the Incredible . Namely , when you are trying to edit anything you have written on the X , you have to physically point to it using your fingertip it IS a touchscreen phone after all . . . howeverand I do NOT have big fingers by any stretchit is NOT so easy to get the curser to place exactly where you want it using your fingertip . . .a problem which the optical track pad made ridiculously simple on the DInc . Its only major flaw of the track padIMOwas that you could n't adjust its sensitivity like you could the old track balls used on older Blackberrys at least not that I could figure out , consequently making moving the curser a bit slow at timesbut infinitely more accurate than having to resort to using your finger to place the curser where you want it . And do n't think that the extra real estate on the X 's screen will make much of a huge difference , because in my experience , it was still a bit frustrating to get that blasted curser in between specific letters you wished to edit . This may not be a factor to many of you , however it certainly has been with me , one that increasingly annoys me the more I have to do it . Had I not owned an Incredible prior to this , I probably would n't even have noticedbut for those wishing to make an informed decision if choosing between the X or the DInc , well its definitely something to consider .UPDATE 4The DX and DInc are the FIRST smartphones I have owned without a full Qwerty keyboard and I have owned plentysomething I thought long hard before buying mostly due to my own reliance addiction to physical keyboards . I briefly considered the iPhone back when I was stuck in Purgatory ie ATT . I considered buying one and using the virtual keyboard because it looked pretty well laid out all things considered . I had a Windows Mobile Tilt 2 for a few months the single worst phone I have EVER ownedmostly due to how bugproned Windows Mobile is not HTC and was n't a huge fan of the landscape keyboard I felt it was actually TOO big to use easily . I thought long hard before purchasing the DInc without a keyboard . The speechtotext feature was simply awesome . It made texting a breeze and after I found a version of Swype to download I was SOLD . The DX comes with Swype and a newer version was updated when I downloaded Froyo and after having a keyboardfree phone now for over a month , I find that with Swype and the speechtotext ability , I do n't miss the keyboard at ALL . In fact I encourage everyone I have a chance to that IF you have an android based phone , if you can get Swype , you will NEVER need one ever again , which is saying a LOT coming from someone who used to feel a keyboard was absolutely ESSENTIAL for texting and emailing . Not any more .What can I say ? I STILL love my phone and all it can do and I am discovering NEW things it can do with new apps almost daily . As for the android operating system ? I am 100 SOLD . All things considered , I do n't know which to endorse , the Incredible or the X . . .it just depends on what you personally like . If you want the extra real estate that the X 's screen provides , well then you ca n't go wrong with it . . .however if you want a phone that 'll do everything the X can only smaller , the Incredible really IS pretty , well , incredible . I say that to make sure , you absolutely MUST go to a store and physically handle BOTH phones first before buying , because if size IS a factor , then think twice before getting the X . While it fits in my pocket and is n't a nuisance to carry , not everyone will feel this way . Just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied . Oh , and good luck ! UPDATE 5Okay , I 've had my phone for nearly a year now and it STILL Rocks ! Honestly , I seriously love my phone . During all this time I 've figured a few things out that I am hoping will help others .First after a few months , I noticed that my screen sensitivity was seriously off , making texting via Swype all but impossible . I 'd restart it , do a battery pull , almost everything without success . I finally Googled the prob and discovered many other people experienced the same thingbut they took note of one thing I had missedit ONLY happened while the phone was plugged into the wall charger . As soon as I figured this out and it WAS exactly the problem , I 've not had any issues since . I do n't know why the screen goes haywire ONLY while being charged , but it does , and as long as you recognize that , you wo n't have to do as I did and erase everything on your phone bringing it back to factory specs only to see the exact same problem persist . Boy that was a mistake to wipe my phone .I've been itching to upgrade my phone to OS 2 .3 .3 aka Gingerbread for quite some time now . Supposedly Verizon Motorola are on the edge of releasing it to the public officiallyhowever , as I write this , no OFFICIAL 2 .3 .3 update has been released by Verizon for the DX . I DID find what appears to be an unofficial GB update that some have insisted were pushed to their phones from Verizon this story has been denied AND confirmed by ' sources ' all over the placewhether or not its real is anyone 's guess at this point . I found it and after a great deal of difficulty , figured how to load it . The typical instructions were far and away over my headbut I ended up downloading it to my computerattaching my phone to it and I just dropped it into my sd card that way . My phone is NOT rooted btw . I was worried that by doing so it would wipe the memorybut it did n't . The overall update was much more cosmetic and less obvious than the initial upgrade from 2 .1 to Froyo . . .however , the changes have been very GOOD ones from my standpoint . The task bar at the top is no longer white , its a dark blue and all the typical images have a whole new look . Dropping the task bar has also been updated . If you have more than one update , you can dismiss each individually or all at once if you prefera small change to be sure , but I have found it to be very convenientmuch more than I had expected . For me personally , my favorite upgrade has been when you text or write , one of my biggest complaints about Froyo was that if you wanted to find some text you noticed had been misspelled , you had to get the curser to move with your finger to the right placewhich in itself was a challenge at times . For those with big fingers , I can only imagine how difficult that has to be . With the upgrade to GB there is a small arrowlike icon that comes up when you write text and it is large enough that using it to point the curser to wherever you want it is n't a problem whatsoever . I am LOVING this new improvement . Along with a few other smallbut very welcome changes like MUCH improved copy pastingwhich really should have been included from the very beginning , it all works for the better .I have also noticed improved performance pretty much all around . Virtually no lagging in between the 7 main screens , faster internet , and faster allaround performance . I have seen several YouTube videos which chronicle the improvements in detail , so you can check them out at your leisure . All I can say is do n't expect Gingerbread to be a HUGE change , more cosmetic , but trust me , these changes are good ones and really does help the phone in many ways .I have decided my next phone will ALSO be an Android . I can not see myself switching to anything by apple at this point . Not for what my Droid offers me right out of the box . What an awesome device .	1
I hope in the future I remember to never buy the Ultra Fine version Spigen screen protector again . It was difficult to get on and once I finally managed to get it on it on I could n't get all the teeny bubbles out no matter what I did . But the worse part is that once it 's on and you look at your screen it 's like looking through foggy water with tiny little black bubblelike pin prick size dots . Think of someone sprinkling very fine pepper on your screen . This is in the screen protector itself , it 's got nothing to do with getting the application bubbles out . I bought it , I put it on and after looking at my phone twice I could n't stand what it did to my beautiful screen display so I removed it and tossed it . Total waste of my money .

Crest OralB Professional Whitening Kit provides all the items you need to whiten your teeth . The kit is easy to use and results are seen within a few short days . This product works and you will see results . I am happy with the results that I received . A word of caution Do n't expect the results to be the same as what a cosmetic dentist can do which can easily cost in the range of 700800 .This kit comes with the following items OralB Professional Precision 4000 Electric Toothbrush with 3 brush head refills Crest 3D White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Toothpaste Crest 3D White MultiCare Whitening Glamourous White Rinse Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Professional SupremeIt is important to note that results will vary depending on the initial state of your teeth . If you smoke or drink certain products this product will improve the color of your teeth but maybe not as much as someone who does not smoke or drink certain beverages such as red wine , coffee , tea , and coke . I started this treatment the day after I had my teeth cleaned at my dentist 's office . This was not by design and it just happened to work out that way but I think it was beneficial to have my teeth professionally cleaned before using this kit .Each element of this kit plays an important role in the whitening process so it is important to use each item . The Precisio 4000 toothbrush has four modes to choose from Daily Clean , Deep Clean , Sensitive , and Whitening . I like that this toothbrush has a pressure sensor alert to let you know if you are brushing too hard . According to my dentist may people equate hard brushing with cleaner teeth but they tend to actually do more damage to their gums which creates further problems .The Crest OralB Professional Whitening Kit works and is easy to use . Results are quickly noticeable and you will definitely see a benefit to your teeth which can improve your smile and selfconfidence . Taking care of our teeth is a daily requirement so it is not difficult to incorporate this product into your routine . I recommend this kit for a whiter and brighter smile .	1
our complaint is n't with the fandango site , its with the theatre . i m 7 months pregnant and some kid nearly shoved me down by having a pushing contest in the lobby . the screen for the movie had this vicious crease on the left side with spots that you could nt help but look at the entire time . there were also kids running back and forth in and out of the theatre which was distracting . we could nt complain to anyone because when the movie was over everything seemed closed ? empty . no one was around but the people leaving the same movie we were in . we were upset about the situation . it would have been better to sit at home and watch a blue ray movie . the movie was so not in hd . in the 30 minutes of previews it promoted old movies being redone in hd , well the movie itself may be hd but watching it at a theatre . . . . . nothing hd about it . it was nt a pleasant experience and i do nt even know what to do with the rest of the money on our gift card , we 're not trying to go back .	0
Went to the lot to see some of the cars they had listed online . I was there for a while , several salesmen walked by and never offered to help . I called a week later to ask about a car they had listed . I spoke with a gentleman and counter offered a reasonable price . He was incredibly rude and hung up on me . Too bad they were so rude , I bought an car the next day .	0

I use my hands a lot for woodworking , yard work , working on mechanical stuff like cars , lawn mowers and similar . Because of that , I get a lot of small cuts and generally use a bandage with neosporin to prevent any kind of infection . I 've had slivers that I could not get out so it is really important to put an antiseptic like neosporin and a bandage .Right now I have a cut on my thumb similar to a paper cut and it is a little painful and difficult to get healed because I 'm washing my hands all the time and that causes the wound to dry up and stay open . So I 've been trying lots of different bandages and just tried one of these Nexcare Waterproof clear bandages . I have to wonder if those that designed these bandages and the packaging actually ever tested them on someone with a bleeding wound or cut . First problem was getting the bandage out of the envelope . Nexcare put a tiny split at the end of the envelope but not enough to get a grip on to pull open the envelope . Bandaid used to have the same type of opening but with a significantly larger split that you could grip to pull open the envelope but now Bandaid does n't even have that and what Nexcare has is not of any use to open the bandage envelope . I can not believe that someone actually put Easy one hand application on the box . I 'm not handicapped nor do I suffer from any maladies that render my hands immobile or otherwise but there is absolutely no way to be able to open and apply one of these Nexcare bandages with one hand unless you are perhaps a magician .Finally on the 3rd or 4th bandage I managed to get one out of the envelope without messing up the bandage . Now comes another problem , there is a paper strip around the edge of the bandage that you also must get off without messing up the bandage itself ! Finally after another 23 tries and throwing the damaged bandages away , I managed to get one intact with the paper strip removed and put it on my finger . It did n't stick very well and basically peeled itself off of my finger . The adhesive is very weak and would definitely not stand up to use or movement or working with your hands .Two thirds of the bandages in the package have such tiny pads that they are of no value at all .Overall , these bandages are totally useless for any cuts or wounds on your hands although they may work on other areas that is not what I needed them for the most .	0
eventually I think I will have them all , to fit every thing that I use batteries for . I did n't need five but they were cheaper than buying one locally . They have a good shelf life and I 'm all prepared for the next need . I 'm well satisfied .	1
This swiffer has been around for a long time , but it still works as good as ever . One thing I use it for that I do n't know if other people try , is to wash down walls . I use the wet pads for this . It works great at removing dust and dirt from walls ! It is also very easy to use on the walls because of the length of the handle . Especially good on bathroom walls that are subjected to steam .	1

We have very hard water and even using a whole house water filter and a water softener , we still end up with deposits in our toilets . I bought this CLR Bath and Kitchen cleaner because it says Quickly cuts through calcium , lime and hard water deposists , soap scum , dulling film and dirt . It does n't do anything . I sprayed into one of our toilets and it foamed . Then after letting it sit awhile , I brushed it , stains were still there . I have better luck using plain bleach . Perhaps the bottle that I bought just had water in it . I 'm going to take it back to the store and get my money back . I have found that CLR products have always been way overhyped and have never performed as advertised .	0

I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon . The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer . They were durable and fit well . They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing I estimate around 4050 washes . So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work . I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi 's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own . But I wanted the less ' slim ' fit of the 505s for work , also wanted the regular and not low rise waist . So I ordered the same exact size and styleBad idea ! The 505s I got came with a tag saying ' sits below waist ' , which is NOT what they used to say . Before , the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s . Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon , I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair . Trying the new pair on , I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my ' man parts ' being crushed in agonizing ways . No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right .Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans , and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area . The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s , but the seat was the main difference . No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505 .And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s in the same color as the new 505s I purchased I noticed something interesting . The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s . It was n't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . The 515s never felt that tough , and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison .I returned them based on a misleading product description no mention of low rise waist and inferior quality . I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store . The previous 505s were also great Fred Meyer of all places though they do n't have the 505s anymore . . . booo . So I 'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them . I 'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . And the better quality denim means they 'll last longer anyway . So here are my comparisonsLevi 's 505 purchased 9 / 10 / 12 from Amazon 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6 / 22 / 2012 from Amazon 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described , and that the quality appears to vary from order to order . I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews . I love Levi 's jeans , and I will continue to buy them , but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing . And remember , if you buy from Amazon , they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items .	0

I do n't know how these actually perform and I 'm not sure how easily one could really judge that . But enough of mine were leaking that I could n't shake them out as they were sticking and clinging together , and I was n't about to try to wash them off and determine which might be good .I thought about not reviewing these , on the off chance that this was a rare thing to happen , but there was clearly no shipping damage they were packed carefully so I have to assume that there are quality control issues .	0

I have purchased these at my local store . I did n't read the description well I guess . I received one pack with 24 poise pads . They was no pack of six just 24 pads . I was charged twenty eight dollars for this ! This is crazy . I bought a pack of 24 pads at my local store for 2 .99 . Something is wrong here . I thought for that price I was going to get 6 packs of 24 . NOT HAPPY ! ! I do like the product but the price takes away anything good I can say .	0
This case / cover is nothing as it was described or pictured when I purchased it , but now that I have received it , I see that the seller has changed the description and the pictures . What I was expecting was a flexi case that covered the edges and back of my phone , what I got was a thin piece of plastic that fits around the outside edge of my phone . Not what I wanted at all ! I am thankful that this was so cheap , because I guess you get what you pay for , but these things will be going into the trash . First of all I wanted a clear case to cover the back of my phone so I could insert a piece of decorative paper to dress it up as I wanted , 2nd of all I do not see how something that only wraps around the edges of my phone is going to protect it in any way . The product did come by the date that it said , but that date kept changing . Originally I expected it to come before Christmas , but then the date changed until after the first of the year . It did end up arriving around 12 / 29 , but I had originally planned in giving one as a gift , but now that I see the poor quality , I wo n't be giving it as a gift anyway . Very disappointing !	0

Well , first of all , I do n't really like the advertising on the box . If you 're not careful , it can certainly be misleading . It says vitamin C antioxidant power of 3 servings of fruits and vegetables ! The only vitamin that 's listed is vitamin C . If it supposedly has fruit and vegetable powder in it , why is that all there is ? Second of all , I think regardless of what these tablets have in them , you 'll be hardpressed to get your kid to even eat one . They are NASTY . I had my sevenyearold taste one , he spit it out . And he 's the least picky kid I 've ever met . He regularly eats blueberries , raspberries and just about every other kind of fruit right out of the fridge , and will often share my salads that have things like spinach and goat cheese and balsamic vinegar and all kinds of other vegetables kids usually reject . But he would NOT eat these things .So , I of course had to taste them also , to see what was so bad about it . They were awful . They had a horrid vitamin taste , and they did n't try very hard to masque it . If you 're going to make a chewable vitamin for kids , it should be at least edible . These are not .Avoid these . They 're expensive for what they are , and there are all sorts of great children 's chewable multivitamins that would be better . My son prefers the Disney Gummy ones .I think I 'll just skip to keeping my fridge full of real fruits and vegetables , and letting my son help himself to those instead .	0

I got it much earlier than expected . And while I noticed a few reviews complaining about a 34chemical34 smell , mine did not have that . I guess it 's a hit or miss type thing .The quality is nice . Much longer and wider than I thought , which I like . The scarf is very thin so it 's not the thing to wear if you want your neck warm , but it is a way cute accessory on a sweater for fall . Where I live , the winters are hardly ever cold so it 's perfect .All in all , definitely a good buy !	1

This cover is great . It protects the back of the phone , and I do nt have to remove the back cover . and it also swings perfectly to the front . The screen still allows full touch sentitivity on that window . and the magnet clasp is perfect , since my phone is always floating around my purse . It doesn come open randomly . I do nt think its shock resistant , but I usually do nt drop my phone . Also , the case is quite slim , so no added bulk .	1

I decided to get rid of my last electric shaver Panasonic ES8152NC and go back to using a rotary one , so after looking around and reading reviews I deided to buy this shaver .The good things about it were that it looked cool , it was extremely easy to clean after each shave , and the battery lasts a long time .The only problem was that this thing ca n't cut . When I first got it , it would sometimes pull hairs . I thought I just needed to get used to rotary head shaver again , but it 's now been 1 .5 months and it 's gotten worse . I have to go over the same are several times and it pulls hairs constantly . . . I even use the prelectric preshave .	0

Let me start by saying that I have tried a few digestive enzymes , and they helped somewhat , but not like these ! My problem is very strange and started about five years ago . The best way I can describe it is the constant feeling of wanting to burp ! Even on an empty stomach , and I feel like I ca n't just easily burp , it takes an effort to where you almost feel like you to get up and walk and move around just to be able to burp , and when you do , it 's such a relief , for maybe five minutes , then it starts ALL over again . And what makes it EVEN worse is exercise ! It 's almost as if when you need to burp there 's this pain in the upper right area behind your back right shoulder blade , and the big burp relieves it ! Like I said , the prilosec OTC would help some , but not completely and I think it would treat the symptoms while making the condition worse . I really ca n't say I have much of a heartburn issue , but I did at times just not often .As soon as I started taking these , the problem was reduced to 90 percent . I still feel the need to burp slightly , but not that critical feeling of I ca n't burp . . . . .Nothing I have taken has given me this much relief . I have n't taken prilosec in three days hope to not ever take it again ! That stuff ca n't be good for your digestion ! There is something in the ingredients list of these enzymes that are NOT in any of the others I 've tried . I do n't know what it is , but wow ! I hope they continue to make these and they continue to keep working because not only have they helped my digestion , I have more energy !	1
Not sure how they did it , but they managed to make these things actually taste good ! Even when my BG is 30 , it 's like having a little treat . They are easy to chew , not chalky , and smooth . No residue and work as quickly as any glucose tabs . I will never buy that flavoredchalk stuff from a drug store again !	1
this website sucks ! it does nt ever have the correct movie times for the theaters it shows ! ! this site is a scam and noone should use it ! if you want actual show times , either go to the theater 's actual website or just call and listen for show times ! fandango is always wrong and causes problems that could have been avoided if they showed movie times that actually existed ! !	0

I would never wear these as a primary layer , but as a base layer with running shorts over it works great . I run about 120 miles per month and have become a believer in compression . It simply works as advertised . You have more stamina and recovery is better . Providing stability and compression makes the muscles work better and helps move lactic acid out postworkout . I even wear compression socks . Yes , they do look stupid . However , they really help . I predict that many more runners will be wearing compression socks and shorts in the future . There is no downside and a ton of upside .	1

The little black tube top that goes under the loose shirt is very short , and there is an elastic band sewn into the top part of it , leaving it hanging loose , and it does run a little small . It is n't as form fitting as on the mannequin , though I did order a medium . When I wear it 5'4 '' 140 lbs C cup , hourglass build the tube top only covers to the middle of my back . It works perfectly for me though because it covers everything I need covered in the front and leaving a little extra sexy back skin showing which was the purpose for me purchasing it in the first place . As all Patty 's shirts , the quality of the material and workmanship is outstanding . It is very comfortable and silky to the touch . It is made with stretchy fabric and moves beautifully . I would suggest ordering your normal size , though if you do go a size up in this particular top , the benefit is a lower neckline and maybe a little looser in the mid section .THESE SHIRTS ARE MADE TO FIT YOUR BODY , NOT TO HIDE LUMPS !	1

This dealerships service department is a scam . My car went in for service yesterday and a few hours after I got a call saying that there was a nail in my rear left tire and it needed to be replaced as it is was not reparable . I opted to take the car as is since the tire was still holding air and drove over to my local discount tire and they removed the wheel , examined it , submerged it in water and did every possible test and sure enough . . . there was no nail / leak . The guys over at Discount simply aired up all 4 tires and reset the sensors and now well over 24 hours later they are still perfect . I made sure to visually examine every aspect of the tire , and when I called the dealer to alert them of my findings , they simply said we have 100 confidence in our service techs , and he said he found a nail . I have heard of scams like this at other dealers , but I thought Sewell was different . I guess I was wrong . After being a loyal Sewell Audi customer and purchasing two vehicles from them , I am extremely disappointed and I will not be returning to this dealer for service nor any other matter .	0

I 've been using Dr Christopher 's Eyebright on / off for the past ten years now after switching from my usual Bayberry Eyebright Liquid formula . I noticed Dr Christopher 's had a stronger alcohol content and it received good reviews a decision that was well worth the investment .I stopped using it for about threeyears due to once it grew in popularity so did the cost . That pissed me off that so many of these big Corporate BooBoo 's do this they get you hooked on their products and then raise the price . I was pleasantly surprise to see , he has now lowered his pricing to something that is more practical .2 . Eyebright Extract Works well you honestly can see results within 24 days of usage .I've been using Eyebright for many years now , that I no longer take according to suggestive usage . The great thing about Eyebright is it 's all natural and does not have any adverse side affects . It is simple to use simply add recommended drops to a glass of water or favorite fruit juice . I no longer use everyday and it seem to last in my system for weeks .I only take whenever I need to rejuvenate my eyes or see that my eyes are starting to become blurry I simply take for about a week and I 'm good to go for weeks . The great thing about Eyebright is it is not habit forming and you decide when it is needed .Check out a former review on Nature 's Answer Eyebrighthttp // www .amazon .com / gp / cdp / memberreviews / A34AZ5B6CCBLPN ? ieUTF8displaypublicpage5sortbyMostRecentReview3 . Taste It 's not the best but bearable . It 's not like your taking it straight your adding it to water or juice and for that very reason the taste does n't matter . Goes well with apple juice water is going to give you the most undesirable taste but probably the most effective for early stage usage . You will be pleasantly surprised no longer having to wear glasses . Close or far sided this product works great and the best part is Eyebright Herb is an all natural remedy for ones eyes .This product is safe for all ages I 've heard people even using for their older / mature dogs and pet . I personally can not recommend as I have never tried nor do I have pets but if you decide to use on any animal try small dosage .In a nutshellI've tried many brands but find Dr Christopher 's seem to be the very best . I will continue to use this as long as their pricing remains low . I am not one who cares for the person 's name / name brands and have found that ' Gaia Eyebright Bayberry Supreme ' a offbrand seem to work just as good and is cost effective for its consumers .You can catch a good sale at swansonvitamins .com as they often have a , buy 1 , get 1 free on the Gaia Eyebright . I highly suggest you sign up for their newsletter . Why buy Dr Christopher 's high shenanigans when you can get two for the price of one and is a pretty decent product . It might not be as good as Dr Christopher 's but it does work . I find that I might have to use it a bit longer but still not everyday suggestive usage .And on that note . . .I am done .This is ' Awakened1 ' and I hope this review helped .

i recently ordered tickets for a film at the amc theatre in burlington , ma . i was disturbed to learn ( after i paid for the tickets ) that this theatre does not accept a printed ticket , as has been the case with every other online ticket i have ever purchased . this information should be prominently displayed , and should be repeated before payment is collected . i thought i was going to have to send my daughter to the theatre with my credit card fortunately they were willing to accept the transaction number as proof . and the burlington cinema should join the 21st century already !	0

I have 3 cases now , this one , the poetic borderline , and mercury tpu . I got to say this one is my favorite . It does n't make the phone too bulky like a Trident case would and the inner is tpu so it wo n't attract lint . Everyone at my school noticed it then first day and wanted one for their phones . The kickstand is sturdy and the pattern on the outer part gives a nice feeling in the hands . Best case I 've owned so far would definitely buy it . And it will fit your phone they have fixed this issue	1

Although Hane 's has a good name behind it , these would constantly fall down , ride down , whatever you want to call it they sucked . I ended up buying some Champion brand and they 're wonderful . Even doubling up the waste band , did n't work . And these were brand new too .	0

I 'm always at a loss for new gift ideas for the runners in my family . I bought our first Peet shoe dryer several years ago on the advice of a local running store owner after I asked for suggestions for Christmas gifts for runners . He recommended this shoe dryer . We already had every other possible running gadget / clothing / etc . . .so went ahead and brought one home . With a husband and teenage son both running long distance daily in all sorts of weather including rain and snow , it has turned out to be incredibly handy at times . Even though they both have an assortment of running shoes for various terrain , conditions , training vs racing , etc . , they can very quickly end up with 23 soaked pairs of training shoes when we start getting into the cold and rainy seasons here in the mountains . While I think the PEET dryer was originally marketed to hunters , it perfectly resolves our soggy running shoe problems .The PEET dryers are completely silent and work by slightly warming the ambient air so that it rises into the shoe . This of course means a slightly slower drying time than it would if the dryer was forcing hot air into the shoe however it wo n't damage your footwear like a higher temp dryer might . The overnight drying of the shoes keeps the shoes from getting stinky with sweat , mold , and mildew . . .which keeps your expensive running shoes from deteriorating before they should . But the best part is sliding your foot into a nicely warmed shoe or boot .It 's also great after sledding or playing in the snow . Invariably , we always get snow down inside our boots . The PEET dryer gives us toasty boots to put on next time . When our teenage son went away to college , we had to get a 2nd PEET for him to take with him .	1

Talked to some women who kept telling me they were n't going to pay for the window that my neighbor broke with his lawn mower after several times telling her he was going to pay for new glass she told me I needed to call someone else about my problem She was rude and very misunderstanding and did n't care about my problem	0
Bought one for me and my boyfriend . We both love it .My boyfriend refers to it as the best one on the market . We do n't have any complaints .If you want to put it on your dash and not your windshield make sure that your car 's dash has a flat surface or it wo n't stick . It does n't like to stick on curved dashes . But if you only want it for your windshield then it does n't matter .	1

I recently got a Samsung Galaxy SII T989 , and I wanted to go all out protecting it since it 's quite an exquisite device I even got the ArmorSuit screen protector for it . The case is pretty well made , although a little odd to install . I think you can just stuff your phone in it like so , but I was confused and ended up putting the rubbery part of it on the phone first , then slide it into the hard plastic piece . All the cutouts for the buttons and connection ports are cut out correctly , and are protected by their own individual flap . It does add a little bulk to the phone , but that 's what you have to be willing to trade off for decent protection . The case feels nice in my hand , and it 's a lot better than TPU cases . TPU cases are thinner and more sleek , but they wo n't protect heavy drops . Also , because I have a rare condition that causes excessive sweating of the hands palmar hyperhidrosis , this case does n't trigger it as much as TPU cases , so it 's less likely that the phone will fly out of my hand due to slipping .Since there 's no Otterbox cases for this phone or at least from what I can find on Google , this is about the best you can get . I 'm sure there are a few hardcore cases out there I did n't see , but I 'm not that guy who has OCD and has to have the best protection . Not saying I drop my phone a lot , I just want a very protective case since the Galaxy SII is pretty highend or midend by today 's standards .	1
My wife was very apprehensive when I got this for us . She was perfectly happy with her file that she has been using for many many years . After trying it , she is elated about how great of job it does and how smooth her heels now feel . She is now trying to get me to use it .	1

When I received the bank I charged it overnight , red light indicated it was charging then turned blue when finished , tried to charge my phone and at first it would n't even recognize my phone then started the charge , which charges very slow . . Then not at all . I would n't recommend this charging bank to anyone , I bought 3 others Ones 2 did n't work and I still have n't received the 3rd one I ordered over a month ago and still waiting for it to come . Very disappointed in this product , guess you get what you pay for . Lesson learned ! !	0

The New Trentium for iPhone 5s is one great case ! I like the protection if provides my phone while allowing me access to all my buttons , switches and ports .I returned to the store where I purchased my phone and the technician saw the case and asked where I got the case . I have a provider for my phone and a different provider for my iPads . The sales reps at the ATT store were inspecting the Trentium and asking where they could obtain them for stock in their stores . The most important feature for the ATT folks was the interchangeable plate on the back of the Trentium case . I guess shoppers have requested cases that highlight the color of their phone while in case .Most importantly for me , is not the color , or style , but protection for my device and this case does it all .I would purchase this case again and recommend it to anyone seeking a case that works as intended .I have purchased other New Trent products in the past and have never been disappointed by the quality , workmanship , functionality or protection they offer .	1

Generally there are no worries when it comes to Clarks footwear . I do n't know what went wrong with this one .

I love my Wet Jet and this scent is my favorite ! It makes my house smell good for hours , and it works extremely well . I clean my floors daily with a Swiffer Vaccuum and a dry cloth mop and only need to use the Wet Jet every few days . We have two big dogs that are outside dogs , but come in at night . My floors are always filthy in the morning since they spend the night on hardwood tile , but this stuff gets the floors shiny and smelling great . I do n't know if you 're supposed to use it on hardwood or not , but I have been using it on mine for six years and I do n't notice any damage / discoloration .	1
This is my first BMW and definitely not my last . My experience with Bryan Clark and Flemington BMW was pleasant and painless . Bryan was knowledgeable , dependable , and expertly answered my questions . My initial deal and tradein were fair , with only minimal negotiation needed .

Make sure you get an outside inspection before buying here ! The team at Ed Voyles was very nice and had the car I was looking for so I made the hour drive to check it out . The sales man assured me they are given a complete inspection and fixed before they are sold . . . well that was a lie . The car I was looking at has completely blown out shocks and struts , tires that had a month or so of tread left , it had a 5 year old battery , an oil leak at the back of the engine and most importantly the tranny fluid was black and covered in black crud with the dip stick completely rusted out . This alone made it clear their mechanics either did n't check it out or are very bad at their jobs . The total for repairs would have 1200 not including the potential catastrophic tranny issue . Stay away unless you are buying new with a warranty .	0

In my amended review I stated that Amazon was extremely helpful in handling the return of a DEFECTIVE BROKEN item . This is yet another amendment . I totally understand that they would have a restocking fee if you were just returning the item for no apparent reason . I also understand that they would then have you pay for the shipping . I sent this broken within 6 weeks of casual wear item back and am appalled that Amazon has the cheek to make me pay for the shipping and for RESTOCKING . What ? ? ? Are they going to re sell my broken earring to some other unsuspecting customer ? This is obviously not a well made item or I got a defective pair . I should not have to pay Amazon 50 out of my hard earned money to return something that is obviously defective and / or broken ! ! Below is my original review which I am now amending . I have had these for about 6 weeks and have worn them about 6 times . Last night , while out for dinner , one of the earrings broke at the stem leading up to the leverback . Luckily I was able to rescue the pearl and the remainder of the earring . I would hesitate recommending these to anyone . They are absolutely beautiful but obviously not very well made . Amazon has been extremely helpful in their handling of this matter for which I 'm thankful .Beautiful earrings that my hubby purchased for Christmas for me . They are beyond beautiful and highly recommended . Well made and came in a beautiful presentation box . Great for gift giving .	0
This is exactly what I was hoping it would be . I usually wear a 1214 so I ordered large in olive , brown , and red . The material is of a nice weight , not to heavy I hate it when long skirts are so heavy that they want to slide down nor is it too light causing every detail of your rear end to show thru . I am 5'5 and the length is perfect . You can fold the top over if you need it any shorter however for my height there was no need to fold . Perfect for flats or low heels . Comfy and easy dress up or down .	1
This did not do any more for my heel pain than a regular sock . I am back to my night splints . Hope other people have better luck than I did .	0

I was a lover of LifeStride shoes and was always confident that I would get THE perfect fit . Last year I purchased the Parigi and was so devastatingly disappointed . This shoe was 2 sizes too large and was a total waste of money . While I love this pair of shoes , I am having second and third thoughts about purchasing another LifeStride given the amount of money I wasted so I am passing on this shoe regardless of the price .	0
I ordered this item , and the first disappointment came when I found out the seller was located in Hong Kong which I did n't find out until after I had placed the order . I could normally care less where a seller is located , but shipping an item that costs less than a dollar halfway across the world is a waste of resources .My second disappointment came when the item took over a month and a half to arrive , which was after the stated delivery date . My final disappointment came when I replaced my old screen protector , only to realize the entire order I received was cut several millimeters too wide , making them all useless . I would request a replacement or refund , except now I do n't have a screen protector and ca n't wait a month and a half to receive a replacement . As for a refund , it 's simply not worth it for less than a dollar .Your mileage may vary , but I ca n't recommend this product from this provider .	0
Horrible . Range was maybe 1034 not 10 metres . From my pant 's pocket it would constantly drop the connection . Also took forever to pair , even with it sitting on the phone Iphone 5S . Did not hold a charge more than 15 20 minutes . Returned for refund . I am assuming it was defective .	0

The Dual USB AC wall charger from New Trent is pretty straightforward , nice form factor with collapsible prongs for easy travel storage .I bought it so that I would only need to carry one adapter to charge both my iPad 3 and my Android phone . Experience has taught me that both devices are best kept topped off in case I need to use power hungry apps when no outlet is convenient or available . I have bought the New Trent battery backups but most of the time it is just easier to keep my devices charged up . I like that the prongs are not polarized 1 larger than the other because this allows me to change orientation in a wall outlet in case I or a friend needs to use the other socket .	1

I recently switched to the traditional safety razor / shaving soap method after years of struggling with razor burn and all the other issues that go with sensitive skin .I have used all kinds of sensitive skin products over the years , and none seemed to help .I switched this shaving soap based on the reviews and recommendations on Amazon .It is pleasant smelling , makes a good lather easily with a badger brush , and does a good job of lubricating your face for the razor .I use the matching after shave lotion in conjunction with this soap . The difference in skin irritation is night and day .If you have sensitive skin , switching to a safety razor and this shaving soap may very well be just what you need . It has definitely worked for me .	1

Anxiously awaited this ring along with a few other purchases and received it today . The ring runs drastically smaller than the size ordered .

I have purchased two bikes from here . The sales process is ok , the service department I would not recommend . They do not keep up with notes on your bike and pretty much do not listen to your request and do not completely fix the bike .

I drive 45 minutes to the dealership and as we are signing the papers I realized it was n't the same car as he emailed me earlier in the day . I leave without a car . They call me the next day and tell me the car they promised is here and to come get it since it was a great deal . I leave work to come get the car and as we 're signing they changed the terms of the lease from 15 , 000 miles to 12 , 000 miles . Minded you they told me to come in because they 'll beat another dealership by 10 dollars a month . They refused to honor the 15 , 000 miles a year and by the time the deal fell through my other offer had been sold . Not ONCE but TWICE did these people try to scheme me into a car . Incredibly dishonest , unprofessional car dealership . Avoid at all costs ! They literally changed the deal as the papers were being signed TWO TIMES .	0

I would like to save as many people the drive to this place . When I called to ask if they could rebuild my final drive on an r1200gs they said it would be around 2500 you just need to buy a new one is what they said . Incredibly confused I called up the Austin bmw dealer the very nice service member said they rebuild them all the time and it would cost me . . . . get ready 300 . Also on a previous service they charged me 145 to torque down a bolt I pointed out . Their excuse for this was well the technitian had to find the bolt on the bike . Really now ? ? so the fact that it was visibly leaking and super accessible justified 145 . Save your money and time and just take your bike to Austin much better service .	0

I have purchased 4 pair of pants from gap , ll bean and columbia . The columbia pants are way too tight . They say 32W , but I could n't even button them . The other 3 pants fit fine , I need a belt in fact . I do n't understand how they can say they are a 32W when matching them up to other pants I purchased and own they are easily 35 inches shorter in the waist .The difference for the next sizes up with the same length some how increases the price of the pants by 20 ! forget it , returning and will not buy from columbia again .	0

I am very disappointed with the brand , Leveret . Not knowing the quality of the brand , I ordered three pair of Leveret pajamas . On one pair , the zipper pulled apart the very first wear . I tried fixing it , but by the third wash and wear it was unreparable and I had to throw them away . The zippers are cheaply made on all three pairs , so I do n't think it was a fluke in the one pair . As for the other two pairI ordered a size up , so the second one has n't been warn . The third pair , she still wears , but I am VERY careful of the zipper b / c of the quality issue . Super cute designs . Cheaply made . I would NOT recommend this brand if you are looking for a quality pajama .	0

Review of the Energizer Single Position Inductive Charger .This inductive charger is Qi compatible as is the Google / LG Nexus 4 . It works as advertised ! I also tested it on the Lumia 920 of a friend and it works on it as well .I was able to charge the Nexus 4 from 60 to 100 in 1 hour and 12 minutes . I recently tested this charger with a slim case on my Nexus 4 and it charged from 24 to 100 in under 3 hours .Although I have no case yet on the Nexus 4 , I did place several pieces of thick card stock between it and this charger and it continues to charge the Nexus 4 . By all indications , if you have a slim case on the Nexus 4 , this charger will work . The blue LED is lit when the phone is charging and goes off when charge is complete . I found the charger to be intuitive in use and so far I have not had any issue of the Nexus 4 sliding due to the incline .Once I get a case , I will update my review . One note is that since phones are now coming out with Qi compatibility , the price here on Amazon has been creeping up 10 .Update 12 / 13 / 2012This charger will work the Diztronic and Ringke Rearth slim cases . I 've been very happy with this charger and not having to use a micro USB cable .Input is 120 / 240 VAC 0 .35 Amp max . Output is 12 VDC 1 Amp .	1

I bought two of these . This was the first one and it was easy to assemble . It took about 3 minutes .When I got the second one , we had a problem getting it to slide down into place . When we compared it with this one , we saw that there was one tab at the top and two tabs at the bottom that seemed like they should slide into the slots . I must have broken the top tab off of this one , because it was super simple to get on . We had a problem with the second one . Solution I broke off the top tab to the second case with pliers and it slide perfectly into place .Edit Had to take the top tab off with pliers to get it to fit on correctly . When I compared to the one I removed , the notch was broken off of that one as well . Not sure if that one broke off on it 's own or arrived that way . Regardless , the tab is not needed and once it was removed , it fit perfectly !	1

Overall this car mount exceeded my expectations . Good build , yes its plastic but all for me the most important part is when the nobs are tightened down they do nt wobble or feel loose . You have the option to mount on the windshield or the dash and even though its pushed to the limit with a phone like the note 3 it still fits even with a case . I ca nt wait to really put this mount to good use , to me its a must have that adds so much convenience . check out a little review of this item link is in the comments	1

I 've got a longterm , recurring , low back issue that pops up sometimes when I 'm doing some lifting or shoveling and did n't remember to watch my stance or wear my support belt . Actually , my support belt up ' til now , was a mesh / velcro thing that was pretty well worn out . I really could never find the right point of tension , but it was better than nothing . . . or so I thought . I got one of Curad 's new Back Support Belts , and yesterday , carried seventeen heavy boxes of flooring up several flights of stairs . The belt is broad , really wellmade , and the miracle of it 's multipoint pulley adjustment system was that I was able to adjust as I went with just the pressure and support I needed . Today ? No pain , not even a tired , tightness . This is a great product ! Got a load of firewood to move ? Boxes of books ? Buy this Back support first .	1

I bought these for my teenage son , and they are his new favorite casual shoes . He wears them to school , around town , and here at home . They are comfortable to walk in , and the liner slips out easily to wash . Our only complaint is that they were very stiff at first , but that was much better after just a day or two . Also , the liner inside feels very snug for the first day or so of wearing , but it will stretch a bit and loosen up . These were definitely true to size , once they loosened a bit . I think he may have needed some time to readjust to wearing heavier shoes after sandals / flipflops , etc all summer long . Great shoes , comfy and warm . Slip on and off easily .	1

I always use Visine for contacts , but I got these drops to sample from my eye doctor last time I went . Of course , they get paid for this . I have only used them a couple of times because I like Visine anyway . To my surprise , I eventually noticed in the label that these are a product of China . Eye drops . . .from China ? ? This is terrible . Had I known this , I never would have put these in my eyes . It says very little of a company that goes all the way to China to save money in making a product that goes into our eyes . China is not precisely known for making good products or caring for quality . They use dangerous ingredients even in toys . They kill their own babies with poisonous formula . Why would they care about our eyes ? This is unacceptable . I would never spend money in this company . Visine drops are made in Belgium , and other Bausch Lomb products are made in the U .S .A . Contact lenses are made here or in Ireland or other European countries . Who goes to China to make eye drops ? Terrible .	0

I have been using this product for fifteen months . Being very price conscious , I was enthusiastic at first despite its very inferior trimming back blade I simply used my old Fusion razor to trim around my nose and edge my sideburns . After about 5 months of usage I began to develop a rash on my face . The first couple of bumps I thought were ingrown hairs , so I attempted to remove any hair in the bumps . But then the bumps increased over a substantial area of my face and neck , which I treated with Four Antibiotic overthecounter ointment but they did not go away and kept increasing . Finally I switched back to the Fusion razor , and they eventually cleared up . Once cleared up , thinking it was a fluke , I continued with the Dorco , changing blades more frequently . Three months later same problem . Finally I had to quit shaving for a week , freeze all the bumps with Compound W , and wait for new skin to emerge problem solved . Being stubborn , I tried the Dorco again . Two months later , five new persistent bumps that would not go away . Back to the Fusion and the problem went away .A new Dorco blade has just enough additional razor drag that once bumps begin to appear , usually along the jaw line , even changing blades on the Dorco will not allow the bumps to heal and they keep increasing with Dorco use . If I use a Fusion blade too long , bumps can start to appear with it also but since the Fusion blades have significantly less razor drag , a quick change to a new Fusion blade allows the bumps to heal in 23 days with no treatment required .I am a 72 year old male . I have been shaving almost every day for sixty years . I have used many different razors over the years . Until I bought this razor , I never had an outbreak like I have experienced with this razor three times in the last 15 months .Now I am happy to pay whatever price is required to purchase Fusion blades , I buy at Costco , in order to avoid what is commonly called barber Itch , which is uncomfortable , difficult to get rid of , unsightly , and even potentially dangerous to your overall health .	0

Friends , listen up ! Stay FAR FAR FAR away from this place . You will only end up being schemed into paying too much for your car . Here are the facts . You come in , get assigned to a sales person , the sales person takes your specs of what you want to spend , what car you want to buy , etc . . so far so normal , right ? Then the sales person goes to their manager behind closed doors to pull up the inventory EVEN THOUGH they have a computer at the desk you are sitting at . What is going on behind the scenes is they are trying to jack up the price ! NO TRANSPARENCY like you have with Toyota and other dealers where you sit side by side and look the the computer together ! THEY WANT TO RIP you OFF !	0

I 've worn them near daily with absolutely no signs of break or wear .

I wish I could give a review for this product , but i ve been waiting a month , and still have no case . The case was supposed to ship Nov . 5th , and they pushed that back a week . I then got an email stating my case had not been shipped because they ran out of them and were unable to fill all the orders . How can this happen if you know before hand how many cases you need ? ? I ordered the case as soon as it was available , so how did mine not get shipped . On top of this , i get another email stating my case would ship Nov 26th on 9 / 21 / 13 . Its on Dec 2 , and i still have no case . The lack of communication from the company is simply appalling . The least they could do is send a different case so my phone is protected while they work the kinks out of production , or get more product . I do n't even want my money back . I want my review to show up as Amazon Verified so people will see the kind of company this is . BUYER BEWARE ! ! ! ! ! !	0

I have taken this product for over a year . It actual inhibits my hair growth . No kidding . While I am taking it , I see fine peach fuzz and baby hairs all around by face , but that is it . When I stopped taking it , my hair grew an inch but got much much thinner . None of the bald spots grew back , not even a little bit . I can honestly say while taking this my hair thickened but just MAINTAINED , did nt grow . My hair was shiny , healthy and thicker looking but that 's it .UPdateSo its true . . . .if you stop taking it , all benefits are lost . Within one month of discontinued use , my hair thinned out horribly . It also was not as shiny or healthy looking . Nothing about my regimen changed besides not taking these vitamins . Not sure what to do now except go back on the vitamins until I do n't care about my hair anymore . UPDATE ! ! ! Avoid Costsell ! I ordred a new bottle of this product and the pills arrived cracaked . My pkg was sealed but how could the pills possible be cracked ? ? ? ? ? Either they are not stored properly or there is impropriety going on ! Refunded by Amazon . Avoid Costsell !	0

Irv Seaver BMW Motorcycles is a place managed by a bunch of stuckup people , closed minded that could n't care less bout customer retention . Me and some friend bought motorcycles from them and after two years I return to buy a 25 , 000 motorcycle but they refused to take my BMW back . They told me that I should sell in craigslist , that was it ! A dealer like this that is not willing to honor a returning customer ara pretty stupid ! I will never come back to this place . BMW from Riverside were very happy to take my motorcycle and their service is great !	0
Great place ! Excellent staff ! Danny A . The used car manager was a huge help !	1
This GIGI Brazillian Body Hard Wax is the worst type of wax that I 've ever used , it 's so sticky and when it dries is hard to remove without leaving traces on the skin , and also is not gentle on the skin at all . I wo n't recommend this product .	0

I received an extended warranty notification in the mail involving my X5 . My engine light was on and I knew it had something to do with parts mentioned in the warranty . After dropping the car off at the dealership , I was told later that day it looked VERY promising it would be covered under the warranty . The next couple days past and I received a voicemail from my service assistant telling me it was n't covered because it was n't the exact module mentioned and it was going to cost me 1200 ! He was leaving for vacation that day and told me to call him . I tried and he responded via text . He told me he was going to tell me someone who could help me in his absence but he never responded to me . After the repairs were completed , I was notified that it did n't solve the problem and they needed over 5k more to repair other parts . I declined and pick my vehicle up , still broken and 1200 dollars less ! It took the dealership over an hour to get me a loaner car and upon my return , it took them 40 minutes to find my car ! They should be able to diagnose ALL issues up front for the prices they charge . This was a bait and switch issue !	0

Of all the dealerships I 've been to this was the worst exp ever . I had made the appointment . Sat down told the sales many everything up front . Had a lot of info as I dealt with Lakeland Toyota the day before . He assured me he could help me get the car I wanted for the payment I was already making . Not the color I wanted cause they only had TWO options He later said because my co signer was self employed there was only one lender that might lend to us . But I would have to take a different car instead so I said ok let me look . When I told him this car was much to small he tried to convince me it was the same size of the car I was in . Mother of two boys I can assure you THIS WAS NOT TRUE ! ! ! He would n't even look at my trade in said i should just get a new loan and let the other car go back . Very unprofessional I 've heard the Kia advertisements hundreds of times I never would have expected any of this when I walked in .	0
I had bought this bra almost two years ago and was disappointed that it was unavailable when I tried to order another . I ordered the blue when it became available again . This is a comfortable bra , the lining is soft and not thick and fake looking like padding , without show through ' . On a very hot day most days here in Jamaica wicks up the perspiration and remains comfortable . No underwire to poke , comfortable straps , triple hook closure and smooth under tshirts .	1

I 've had a lot of spinal surgeries seven , to be exact . With four levels of my lumbar vertebrae fused , I can no longer bend over enough to put on my shoes or tie the laces . I solved the laces problem by buying a pair of shoes with velcro straps , but I still had difficulty getting my shoes on . I bought a plastic shoehorn several years ago , and it has been okay , but when I was asked to evaluate and review this shoe horn , I was glad to oblige .I like this shoe horn . The extendable handle , the spring that gives it a little flexibility , and the steel paddle are nice features that make it superior to my old plastic shoe horn , which I was always afraid would break . It did take me a few tries to get used to the spring that allowed the paddle to flex , and if I had my preference , I might make the handle nonrotating , but it did n't take too long to figure it out .I've learned the hard way that many people with severe back problems need two things a reacher and a long shoehorn . I recommend this shoe horn to older people or postop patients who lack the flexibility to be able to put on their shoes or slippers by themselves .A product sample was provided for review purposes .	1

I just tried the chocolate and what I was disappointed in was the ingredients . Which I had to request a sample to even see the ingredients because I did not see them listed on their web site . natural flavor can mean anything . So I will definitely not be buying the chocolate protein powder . And the chocolate also contains xanthan gum . Which I was surprised since they claim to be very health concious .But to me the chocolate flavor was very bland . almost like dirt with a slight chocolate taste . I 'm sure I could doctor it up but I try to avoid products with xanthan gum natural flavors .	0

My digestion inability has caused me many issues over the years . I will pass out , my comprehension skills are diminished severely , my memory is nonexistent , I get acne , hives blisters depending on the food . Just a sprinkle of any grain , any dairy , table sugar , anything artificial , too many preservatives , or eating too much meat / nuts cause me the most problems .These capsules from renewlife work within about 20 min to get rid of all those symptoms . They feel more balanced then those of enzymedica 's glutenease or their very strong digestease . That brand products work , but they feel too strong , you get hungry again fast they make you feel like you can eat anything after only 1 pill so I try to only take on rare occasions .Remember , digestion enzymes are always needed , but never rely on them to the point that you start eating again / more nutrition deficient foods like soda or processed candy bars / deserts . Also see an acupuncturist herbalist to help heal your body .	1
My wife and i went to the dealer to get our mazda checked because of a switch shift gear part that needed to be replaced we tried talking to the mazda mechanics that we only need a part replacement but i am guessing they did nt like that we already knew what was wrong With our car , we gave him a part number and what the part was and the guy was trying to tell us that we did nt know what we were talking about , he instead was trying to convince us that something else was wrong and that car needed to be scanned to find the real problem , so we asked them if our easy care that we payed a thousand dollars would cover the scan , he answer with we do nt know yet until we scan it . . . that makes 0 sense , we have been going to that dealer from way before they had their new building set up and everytime we go there they are trying to charge us for stuff that my car does nt need , it feels like everytime we go its like talking to a wall that does nt understand that there are people out there that knows more about cars and think they can rip people off with problems that do nt really exist .	0

I got these to help keep hot chocolate hot a bit longer , and decided I 'd try and anticipate when the maildelivery person was coming and the UPS and FedEx drivers and offer them some hot chocolate to go . These will work out very well . They do retain heat and cold longer than a regular cup , and the size is perfect for a ' double ' hot chocolate I love LandOLakes brand because they use real milk and not nondairy creamer like many instant cocoa 's use gross , huh ? . Anyhoo I 'm quite pleased , and can see keeping these around all year lemonade will be good in the summer for the drivers , too	1

I have used Biotene Dry Mouth Oral Rinse for many years and loved the product . It was always gentle and effective . Imagine my surprise when I tried my most recent purchase and it caused my mouth to burn so badly that I had to rinse it out . There was also a strong 34minty34 smell that was not there before . I bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same . I am deeply saddened that I can not use this product any more and wonder what I will do . Also I am miffed that I paid big bucks for two bottles of Biotene that I ca n't use .Why would a company make a horrible change like this . It is new product development gone horribly awry . People with dry mouth also often have a very sensitive mouth . DUH . Lets make a product that our customer base ca n't use .I noticed the the company posted a response to one of the amazon reviews saying call us and let us know about your problem . I called twice today and after waiting over ten minutes each time gave up . I then sent two emails , neither of which have been answered . So much for their caring and great customer service .	0

I bought these for myself after reading the reviews and noticing that one man said his wife liked them . I 'm 5 ' 4 1 / 2 , so they are long , but it does n't matter in the house if they drag along the carpet . They are wonderfully soft , silky and comfortable . It 's like having nothing on , but better . I wear a size 8 and bought the men 's medium They fit well at the waist and hips , and are roomy in the legs . Just what I wanted . They also wash and dry beautifully on gentle warm wash and low dryer heat .	1
There has not been a single problem with this charger . I have gone through a lot of cheap chargers and decided to spend what was necessary to get a good charger .

why ca n't i display movie times for a specific movie at my favorite theaters , rather than by zip code ? it 's frustrating it wo n't work that way . also annoying is that there is no way to spacify range ( miles ) when specifying zip code , since i am apparently willing to drive outside the range you set fir the specifed zip code . this would be the better solution , since it would then obviate the need for specifying favorite theaters . any fixes suggestions ?	0

It is disgusting to know and to have white Tongue Cheese , a gunk at the back of your tongue . This removes it well enough . Other items are brushes you need to replace that can be costly .

My son recommended this OtterBox Defender for my new iPhone 5 . He certainly knows more about these things than I do , and this time his recommendation was right on the money . This is a very high quality case for the iPhone 5 . The fit is impeccable it literally fits the iPhone 5 like a glove . Basically this case is a hard plastic case surrounded by a rubberized outer housing that affords an excellent grip and which should cushion the iPhone 5 from the inevitable drops and jostling to which we all subject our iPhones . The lip around the screen is very wellrecessed which should protect the screen protector from getting scratched if you set the iPhone down facedown , as we all sometimes do . The case looks very professional .This case also comes with a built in screen protector . My iPhone 5 already had a standard peelon screen protector that I have chosen not to remove , but even with two layers of protection the touchscreen on the iPhone 5 works perfectly . The rubberized surface for the on / off switch and the control button on the iPhone 5 work perfectly as well . There are cutouts for the front and rear camera lenses so no problem there .There is a rubberized fitting that fits over the lightning connector that is welldesigned and which protects the connector . Personally I probably would have been happy if the OtterBox simply left the connector unprotected , but in practice this arrangement works out well .About the only negative for this case is the inevitable fact that it adds a certain amount of bulk to the iPhone 5 as the price you pay for firstrate protection . That is fine with me but if you are one of those folks who really insists upon having the slimmest iPhone possible this case may not be for you . This case is definitely for me as I value the protection and like the appearance and utility of this case .The flip side of the extra bulk that this case imparts to the iPhone is that I like the heft of the phone when talking on it . And while the OtterBox makes the phone larger , it adds very little weight , so that the iPhone 5 even in this case is a pretty lightweight accessory . Nice .The Amazon price is a bargain . Recommended . RJB .	1

Last night the service indicator came on , indicating that my Mini needed an oil change . This morning I drove across town to Motor City Mini to have this addressed . I spoke with Matt Delbeke , and was told they were busy and could not service the car today . I told him that I was booked for basically the next two weeks , and today was my best opportunity . He checked with his boss and the answer was still no . Matt , and the other service advisors asked if I had an appointment . No , I did not . That said , I have owned a lot of cars in the last 40 years , foreign and domestic . During this time , I have never had a dealer require an appointment for an oil change . Never . This is not a major service and I did n't show up halfway through the day and expect them to take care of me . I was there shortly after they opened . This car is under warranty , and has an EasyCare plan , so I do n't want to go outside the dealer network for service . The dealer network ? Mini of Ann Arbor and Mini of Grand Rapids , in addition to Motor City Mini . No other options that are just around the corner . Despite the Mini being a great car , this lack of dealers and difficulty in getting even simple service like an oil change makes me rethink my choice of a Mini .	0
I 've got very dry skin , so I 'm always looking for a better shaving gel . This is the best I have found so far . I use a safety razor and the only blades I 've found that can get through my stubble are the Feather blades and they require some caution to keep away the cuts . Previously , I used shaving soap , but it dried my skin too much so I decided to move onto a gel . I 've tried a number of different gels and this is , by far , the best gel I 've ever used . I cut very easily and this limits those to a minimum . The pricing is also very reasonable . If you 've got sensitive skin , give this a try !	1

Another NIGHTMARE at BMW Mt . View ! STAY AWAY . Three weeks ago I showed up to buy an X3 . The sales person pointed us to a preowned model . I testdrove it , we liked it . We said we 'd buy it , walked with the sales rep to his desk and began writing up the sale . Another sales rep , noting our intent to buy the car , pulls an endaround on behalf of a different customer and reserves the car in the dealer computer system . So , as we 're holding the keys in our hand and watching our sales rep punch in our purchase data , the sales manager Steve comes over and with the most roundabout and convoluted explanation tells us we ca n't buy the car and asks for the keys . They simply refuse a sale . And they ca n't explain the process by which they 've made that decision . After putting up a bit of resistance , we walked away , assuming BMW would help us find a replacement . That 's when my disgust with this dealer went through the roof . They proposed a new car , 10k more expensive . They proved , after several conversations , incapable of finding even a remotely comparable offer , and they offered zero creativity to help me find a car . THESE GUYS ARE INCOMPETENT . STAY AWAY .	0

my husband and i go to the movies every tuesday , our family members have given us fandango gift cards for christmas and we have asked them not to anymore because it is a big ripoff . when we pay at the box office it cost 5 . 50 for seniors , which comes to 11 . 00 , with your gift card you have to order your tickets on line and there is no senior rates , so each adult ticket cost 8 . 75 , plus you have the nerve to charge a 1 . 25 convenience fee , which makes the total 20 . 00 , that 's a ripoff .	0

Had to return after thousands to get the original problem fixed . Problems I did n't have when I arrived seemed to materialize upon the vehicles return . When asked to take some responsibility for not communicating some previously needed repairs I was hung up on .	0
I did n't notice that it was only rated 45 watts , no wonder it ca n't even keep hot water warm . It is a pathetic product proclaiming to be a warm water massage . It does have a button stating 34Heat34 but it might as well not even be there , there is NO benefit other than cooling bubbles when it is pressed . If it had a decent heater I would have rated it much higher . However the lack of heat is an obstacle that can not be overlooked . Now to go hunting for a foot spa with a decent heating element .	0
I do n't know whether the unanimous 5star reviews made me expect something too fancy , but I have to say that I was very disappointed when I received this hat . It is not warm at all . The faux fur does not provide a pleasant feeling and seems like it will fall off pretty quickly I had some of it on my hand the only time I touched it . In addition , the inside of the hat is all polyester no fur and feels cold .	0

It says it fights spots and residues , removes hard water film and tackles tough stains but it my opinion it does the exact opposite . My dishes have never looked this disgusting after a wash when using this Finish Power up booster . I was just introduced to Finish Quantum with Baking Soda and loved them , they clean my dishes well . But when paired up with this booster it does nothing to my dishes . All of my dishes had this white like residue . Two washes and it would not come off , I had to hand wash all the dishes that were in that load . It seemed to cake on the food as well and not remove anything but actually make it worst with a white residue . I have never had my dishes look as filthy .At first I thought maybe my dishwasher was messing up and it was just coincidence that it was happening as the same time as I started using this . But , after reading other reviews I find that it is actually this Finish power up booster which really lowers my appraise of Finish . I was very thrilled with Finish after using the Finish Quantum with Baking Soda , but this product makes me second guess them .	0
I purchased this protein shake knowing that I needed more protein in my diet and looking for a shake that is great for post workouts besides Muscle Milk . After reading the label , I really liked how it had low sugar , carbohydrates and more protein . I tried the Vanilla Cream and loved the creamy taste it had . I will definitely be buying more Pure Protein shakes for my post workouts !	1

The combination rubber / fabric tip is not like most other styli . It Is smooth to use albeit a bit less sensitive than many of the standard rubber tipped ones . That just may be a plus . The false taps and swipes are minimized .I bought the amPen stylus in the hope it would last longer than my traditional ones have . After three monthsso far so good . Replacement tips are available should the original eventually fail .I have been quite satisfied with the stylus . I am sure you would be too .	1

I ordered these shoes 1 / 2 size smaller than I usually buy running shoes / trainers , because they came in a 9 1 / 2 wide width , and they fit perfectly . They are the lightest most comfortable shoes I have ever worn , with plenty of room in the toe area and no inside seams to chafe my feet when I 'm walking / bodypump class etc . I think they 'll be perfect in the brutal Texas summer , also , since the materials are so lightweight . The bright orange / tomatored accents are pretty against the light grey .	1

I got this kit for the mirror with the combination LED light built into it . The mirrorlight combo was . . . disappointing , to say the least . The performance of the light is just pitiful . Holding the light in my mouth , I can barely see more than if I just tilt my head so the bathroom lights shine in . Compared to my little handheld flashlight I have been using , this thing is pathetic , and I threw it away . I had no interest in the rest of the tools that came with this package , just the lighted mirror , and that was a MASSIVE disappointment . I will keep using my little flashlight instead , as that actually WORKS . If my little flashlight output around 300 lumens , then this lighted mirror outputs around 12 lumens , if that .1 star	0

a friend of mine used your service today to purchase tickets to mission impossible on saturday . he accidentally chose today 's date and processed the transaction . he realized his mistake and called your customer service within 5 minutes of processing the transaction . he was told several times that fandango will not break it 's policy of no refunds within 2 hours of a show . when he asked to speak to a supervisor he was told none were available . after several frustrating minutes on the phone , he hung up and called the theatre directly . the theatre offered to switch the tickets at no charge to the correct day . while i understand the need for policies , your employees should understand the need for customer service . both he and i will be cancelling our fandango accounts effective immediately . i will be gladly posting this to social media so others are aware of just how well you take care of your customers .	0

Went in today to work with if I remember right , Eddie and Josh . Both were completely condescending . The salesman questioned my ability to make a down payment and the sales manager offered 1500 less for my trade than I 've gotten at other nonHendrick dealerships . I had a terrible experience at another Hendrick dealership and tried to give the brand another chance at a different location but I should ve just trusted my gut and stayed away . Tried to negotiate a little better trade in price and the sales manager literally laughed at me . I will never stop foot in another Hendrick dealership . These guys are just here to rip people off .	0
This is an excellent watch for the price . It is remarkably well made and VERY good looking . The watch runs consistently fast by 12 seconds every 24 hours , which is not unusual for a new automatic I am sure it will be possible to take it to a professional shop to have it adjusted to a substantially better performance , which I 've had done in many other cases for new automatic watches performing with much lesser accuracy .	1

This place has some of the most incompetent staff . All we needed was the title to the car my girlfriend purchased there so we could switch the plates when she moved to NY , and the woman we dealt with misplaced the paperwork and then took forever to mail it after finding it . She also needed to simply remove a name from the title , which she did not , so we have had to make several trips to the DMV , all the while driving a car which can not get inspected due to her incompetence . It was basically two minor parts of her job which she obviously could not handle . She also avoided our phone calls and it took over a week for her to get back to us .	0

I ca n't believe how high the reviews are for this stuff , but I guess different things work for different people . I got a ginormous cold sore a few days before I was to start a new job I tend to get them when I 'm stressed and not getting enough sleep . I paid 14 for this itty bitty tube because I was desperate to get rid of the cold sore quickly . . .well , Abreva did NOTHING ! I ended up going to the gas station and buying a tube of carmex for 1 .29 which dried up the sore in a couple of days .I have since started using deodorant . . .yes , it actually works has to be gel . I got this tip on youtube from a girl that suffered chronic cold sores after I got another huge outbreak before a big party . I use Almay gel hypoallergenic deodorant costs less than 3 at the drugstore . I apply it to the cold sore at night with a Qtip and after the first application the sore is half the size . I use carmex during the day . I 've found that if I apply Carmex the moment I get that tingling , I wo n't get a cold sore so I always have carmex on hand . But if I do n't use the carmex in time and have an outbreak , I just use the deodorant and it works . . .significant improvement after one use and within 45 days the sore is completely gone .Now I only get 1 or 2 cold sore outbreaks a year . To me , Abreva is way too expensive and minimally effective . If you 're going to spend 14 on this I 'd spend 5 and try the carmex / gel deodorant 1st .	0
Bought mine at Walmart . . .after three weeks it stopped working , even with fresh batteries . Girl on the phone said I needed to clean the unit and let it dry out , claimed being damp or dirty could make it stop working . Really ? A toothbrush holder that ca n't get damp ? ! ? ! I told her it was completely dry , been sitting unused for two weeks . Battery compartment still clean and pristine . Of course a little dry toothpaste inside . She repeated I needed to clean it with alcohol . I told her that , not trying to be a jerk or anything , but if you ca n't get a toothbrush holder damp or dirty then there is a design flaw and I wanted to send it back so they could inspect the problem and get a refund and she told me she could not do that and I had to return it back to Walmart . rolling eyesCheap piece of junk .	0

I should have read the reviews first . I thought something was wrong with the one I bought from a store . I was feeling no suction at all and I mean NO SUCTION . It could not even grip a piece of ripped plastic from a grocery bag . It just makes noise .If anyone tells you that the product does not suck is telling you a half truth . It does not suck wax but it does suck big time . The product simply sucks ! It does make noise as you can feel the exhaust air blowing slightly out the sides . This means the product both blows and sucks ! It sucks eggs and not wax ! One person gave this 5 stars so I am assuming an employee for the company stopped by or someone is not telling them that their ears are filled with wax . This product would not even suck up a fine loose ear hair .If you are a junk collector then can I recommend the WaxVac Cleaner ! ! ! ! It really sucks ! Look up sucks in the Webster Dictionary and WaxVac is number one on the list .WaxVac would make a nice Christmas gift to that one person who means nothing to you P	0

This is first epilator I have purchased and it will be the last as well . I get a smoother effect using a razor than I do using this device of torture . Also the epilator only catches hairs of a certain length , so if you use just an epilator you will constantly have stubble . I find that I have to use the epilator once a week to keep the hair at bay . Another thing is the epilator makes my legs all bumpy for days afterwards . Even my boyfriend noticed this . Not attractive to have bumpy legs . And satin is not bumpy . I used this product regularly for a month to give it a fair shake and I am not impressed .	0

This product is a perfect example of why you should look past the calories and macronutrients and actually read the ingredients . Because if you did the former you 'd say Oh , a diet bar that 's only 200 calories and 10 grams of protein , not bad ! I see that many other reviewers have done exactly this . Here is why you should read on , and keep in mind that ingredients are in order of amounts per bar , highest to lowest . The top 4 ingredients areCorn SyrupThis is sugar .Soluble corn fiberThis is a filler / fiber / sweetener .SugarThis is sugar . High maltose corn syrupThis is sugar / preservative .Slimfast calls this a a ' meal bar ' and tells you to eat 2 of them a day ! THIS IS A CANDY BAR with some whey and soy protein added . This is not healthy food . It is the opposite . There is very little regulation of the diet industry in terms of marketing . Marketing this bar as diet food is borderline criminal . If you 're dieting please do yourself a favor and read the labels on every snack that slimfast produces . They basically sell junk food in smaller than normal portion sizes relying on the lower calories to cut weight . You could cut a king sized snickers bar in half and there you have your two ' meal bars ' , that 's effectively what you 're eating with this .	0

Due to a pain disorder clothing can feel very rough to my skin . I love leggings but they can be hard to find in a fabric I can bear . These leggings are wonderful ! They are well made and opaque to wear under skirts , but they are not too heavy that you get overheated . The waist has a nice / wellmade band and the fabric is very soft . I am a real medium in clothing and these mediums fit very well . The waist comes to the waist , the crotch stays where it 's supposed to be , and they end at the ankle . I love these and only wish that there were more colors ! The shipping was fast tooearly ! I will definitely be buying more from this company !	1
After trying LypoSpheric Vitamin C for several days , I 've found that an entire packet whisked into orange juice with a fork since it does n't dissolve causes me to have gassiness and bowel looseness , obviously negating any benefits it might have . This was not supposed to happen . . .but it did . I might wait for my plumbing to settle down then give it another chance by trying half a packet for a day or twowith food instead of on an empty stomach as recommended . However , even if this does work , using half a packet will be messy , inexact , and inconvenient . Most likely I will just give the rest of the box away and not buy any more .From what I 've read and what I 'd been told , LypoSpheric C is supposed to absorb immediately , bypassing the digestive tract and eliminating bowel issues . This turns out to be mostly marketing hype . In actuality , it does nothing of the sort . It makes its way through the GI tract the same as anything else you eat or drink . If you have IBS or trouble tolerating ordinary vitamin C , you will very likely have trouble tolerating LypoSpheric C as well . Additionally , this stuff is n't cheap . I 'd suggest a jar of powdered , buffered C from the health food store instead .	0

A couple months after I purchased a certified preowned BMW from BMW of Nashville , the paint on the front bumper started to chip off . I soon discovered that this want not covered by the warranty because it was not the factory paint job . BMW of Nashville had quick painted meaning they did n't strip , etc as factory recommends , nor did they disclose to me that it had been repainted when I was purchasing . When I initially connected them , they confirmed the bumper had been repainted and agreed to rectify by sending me a check so I can have a certified BMW body shop strip and repaint . 2 months and several email later , I have yet to receive this check . Not what you 'd expect from a certified preowned purchase from an allegedly reputable dealership .	0

Does a great job at providing compression and comfort at the same time . And most importantly , still feels like new after a month of use ! Finally have a winner here !	1

I am a manly man with a manly need for odor control in my manly arm pits . Thanks to Speed Stick Gear Antiperspirant , my manly pits stay dry and odor free all day . Well , there is the odor of the deodorant but that is a good manly odor , as unlike a bad manly odor as one can get . My wife loves the smell . She says it makes her feel like alternately like a tigress in heat and like a princess locked in a tower , waiting to be rescued by her manly knight me . I prefer that the smell make her feel like a tigress in heat but it seems more frequent that it makes her feel like a princess . When she feels like a princess , even though I am her knight , she mostly just bosses me around , and not in a sexy way but in a 34Hey , manly man , how about unclogging that toilet34 kind of way . I 'm experimenting with different amounts of this product , trying to get more of the tigress days but have yet to discover the perfect amount . Now that I think of it , I think it was copious amounts of alcohol that made her feel like a tigress in heat .Well , anyway , I really like this deodorant . It glides on smoothly , it smells good , it keeps me from smelling bad , and it helps me feel manly .	1

I love MusclePharm products . I do . I love the protein powders a lot , but their pre workout and post recovery drink mixes just do n't sit well with me .I drank this as directed , I let it even digest for 2030 minutes before working out because it needs so much water .I have to say , after drinking this and then drinking the Recovery after my workout , they had me go to the restroom a lot . A lot a lot .So I stopped drinking the pre workout it gave me green colored diarrhea . So I thought , okay I 'll stick with only the recovery drink and protein mix . Well drinking the Recon Recovery , I still had frequent bathroom trips . I had diarrhea every single time , sometimes it even burned . What ever is in this product , it is n't 34Fueling Athletes Safely34 as it states on their label . It 's a false statement , the fact they use artificial coloring and flavors makes it worse , but its hard to find a naturally flavored pre workout and post workout .I ca n't drink this stuff anymore because the strain it put on my body .	0

I have been using a different krill oil brand with great success . I was hoping to save a small amount of money switching brands . Very disappointed to receive a bottle with several broken capsules that coated all the other capsules and made the whole bottle of capsules foul and rancid smelling . No other items in my order were damaged , just this one . Going back to the other brand as I never once received a damaged product and do n't need the hassle . The other brand is also smaller sized capsules .	0
Works awesome !

i received a fandango card as a gift and after using it , i found it to be a big rip off ! i could of bought 2 ticket for 16 . 00 , with the fandango card it cost me more . . . l now i have a balance on the card that is less than a price of a ticket and guess who gets to keep the money . . . so the two tickets cost me 25 . 00 ( verus 16 . 00 ) ! guess who will be announcing my experience to the internet ? me !	0

I received this yesterday and could not believe how pretty it was . I refuse to spend thousands on real diamonds at this point in my life . It is a man made industry , with a man made demand . But I like pretty things and my husband likes me to wear a wedding ring . So after I lost another ring that I paid quite a bit more although still not real , I decided to try here . I purchased three rings and this is by far the most authentic looking one . It 's a great size to fool anyone who does n't carry around a jeweler 's loop . I have extremely wealthy clients and they have amazing , real rings and I would put this up to a lot of them . However , this review is for the ring out of the box . The real test will be to see if it lasts . I have high hopes because I really do like it . I will update later for how it wears over the course of a few months .	1
Works perfectly in my car . It is also universal so it works with many other USB cords . Love this item . Highly recommended . I especially love that it is pink too .	1

My friend told us we just had to go to Royal Kia and I am so glad we did . Juan greeted us when we stopped by and I do n't think you can find a nicer salesperson anywhere . We were so impressed by what this dealership has to offer and Juan found us some great vehicles to look at . We ended up buying a Kia Sportage that is the perfect fit for our family and even got a monthly payment well under what we were expecting . Whenever we can get to the point of getting a 2nd vehicle , we will definitely go to Juan and I am telling everyone I know that if they need a new vehicle . . go see him ! We really have felt like we have been welcomed into a family , not something you will find anywhere else !	1

This dealership is simply outstanding . I just purchased my second RX350 from Karan Singh and he is a pleasure to deal with in every aspect of the sales transaction . Knowledgeable , professional , courteous , and very fair throughout the negotiation . Clearly the best buying experience ever in purchasing a car . And he is supported by a great team of professionals in Rebecca Halprin and Pete Quagliaroli . Their service department is second to none . The team at Hoffman Lexus makes me feel like I am the only person in the building every time I am there for a service visit or a purchase . Wish I could give a rating of more than five stars .	1
No price tag on ANY of the used cars . Sales people had no pricing either . If you want a price , you had to walk around the car lot w / huge amounts of used cars , take a picture of the ones you had any interest , go inside the dealership , fill out paperwork , give info to salesman , he entered info into computer , then . . . he had to go into his managers office to get pricing ! ! HORRIBLE disorganized process and waste of time . We were there for over an hour and never did get pricing ! ! HORRIBLE . . .	0
The worst customer service I have ever had at any car shop . Very rude staff member Nolan Souder , he was eating his lunch right in front of me like I was bothering him or something . Just overall worst experience I 've ever had there . It takes years to gain trust and a matter of seconds to lose them we 'll need less to say my family will not be bringing are cars back to this company anymore . I will be contacting the GM .	0

Now that the price has come down , this is just a fantastic bargain for a very fullfeatured phone .First of all , the connectivity is impressive . WiFi and stereo Bluetooth , and it even supports VOIP i .e . , Tmo 's home service . Email and messaging is superb , I do lots of txt and get IM notifications , plus all my IM clients on this phone and the conversations are all integrated into one list , very handy . I have the Blackberry Unlimited data plan unlimited texts , which i consider necessary because this slick messaging interface tends to lead to excessive messaging . But that 's why you get a Blackberry , right ? I had a Tmo Dash before this , and this just blows it out of the water . They have a similar feature set , but the Dash 's camera is all but unusable , takes lousy pictures , the screen is hard to see in bright daylight , and the Blackberry OS makes Win Mobile seem clunky and confusing by comparison . It would be nice if the BB took video too , but cell phone video kind of sucks anyway .If you 're one of those highly connected social networking types , there is a Facebook app , numerous IM clients , and a Flickr uploader that makes posting pictures effortless . I installed Google Maps , and even though the Tmo version of the Curve has no GPS , the gMaps application gets it close enough by triangulating your location . It wo n't give you turn by turn nav but it really helps if you 're lost , plus it 's close enough so that using the traffic overlay is very helpful to avoid delays . The internet browsing is very satisfactory and superior to the Dash 's mobile IE . Also , installing all these addon apps is extremely easy . There are even some cool free versions of games that are quite fun to play with the little trackball .I keep logged in to all these different things , and Bluetooth running all the time with WiFi wherever available this is one busy little phone but the processor is more than adequate to the task of keeping up , and the battery life is impressive with all these things running . With the Dash , out of memory errors trying to run the worthless camera were common , and the WiFi , Bluetooth , and any kind of multimedia usage would drain the battery way too fast . With the Dash , I had to constantly make sure I was being conservative with what I had running , and that 's just no fun at all .Multimedia capabilities are very nice , I have a 4 gig micro SD and some stereo bluetooth peripherals i recommendAltec Lansing T515 Portable Speaker for Stereo Bluetooth Phone and you 've got a very slick portable entertainment system .The little scroll wheel was a bit awkward for me at first , but now when I try to navigate other phones , I really miss it . If you 've not had a BB before , it 's a good idea to run through the tutorial when you set it up , there are some very very handy keyboard shortcuts that will make things much easier .All in all , this is a fantastic smartphone that can actually keep up with me , and that 's saying a lot .	1
absolute worst customer service of my entire life . i have been on hold for over an hour waiting for a customer service rep . i call back at all different times of the day and it 's the same thing i wait at least 30 minutes and then get tired and hang up . your live chat is the same way over 30 minute wait and still no rep to assist . if this is your tactic to hope that customers with issues will give up and go away it 's very effective . i will not be a returning customer and i 'll be sure to share with everyone my awful continued experience in dealing with your company	0

i am a grandfather that takes his grandkids to the movies on a regular basis . all my grandkids bought me these movie cards so that i would not be spending my money on them all the time . i drove an hour to the movie place and they do not accept them at the theater like the amc cards . i had to drive back home with a bunch of unhappy kids because grandpa did nt have enough money to pay for the movie . i eventually got somebody else to order my some tickets and they took a convenience fee out and of course there is an unused portion left on the card . i was totally inconvenieced and got charged for it . i have spread the word to my family and anybody else who will listen about what a rip off i consider the fandango card . i did not even pay for the card and was really put off by how it operates . i hope that you consider changing how it works for your other customers . i will not be purchasing any of your cards . amc cards work at the point of service .	0
I moved from drinking Pure Protein to Optimum Nutrition because of its lesser cholesterol . Pure Protein had 80 mg of cholesterol as opposed to Optimums 30 mg of cholesterol . The lesser the cholesterol , the better for me ! ! If there 's another protein shake with less than 30 mg of cholesterol drop me a message . Otherwise , I 'm liking this stuff . So far no bad aftertaste . Blends well . Nothing bad to say .	1
i 'm a little miffed . i attempted to purchase 2 tickets for a movie . on the web page where you have a choice for entering credit card , paypal , fandango card , gift card , etc . you have no radio button for gift card . so i entered the gift card number anyway . i clicked apply . then i get to a screen showing that i 'm to enter the gift card number again . yet on the right it shows that the for the gift card was applied . what a mess . there 's no way i 'm entering the gift card number again because i 'm sure i would get dinged twice . very poor experience . needs to be fixed .	0

In the past , I have tried Listerine whitening strips and Rembrandt 2Hour . My husband age 57 and a coffee drinker , has tried products from our dentist with the tray and bleaching product called Nite White . Nite White only whitened his teeth about one shade . We were not happy with that result and ordered twice , thinking the first one was bad or near expiration . Second one did n't do anything either . On Nite White , he went from the light brown stage to a very dark yellow stage not much improvement at all . . .in fact barely noticeable . He seemed to want to give up on the process , but I convinced him to just try the strips and now he 's preferring them to the tray treatments .So I happened to find a 10 coupon in the mailers and said what the heck , and picked these up at Target . They were 49 .99 there , so kind of pricey , but we did n't want to try Nite White any more and have another poor result .With the Crest 3D Professional Effects , and after 4 strips , he is now seeing very marked improvement . He is happy to finally be seeing a true result and wants to continue with his progress . I tried them once and had improvement already . One box will certainly be enough for both of us . They adhere well to the teeth , and when removing just start on one side at the back and pull around to the other side .We use Sensodyne to help reduce the sensitivity that may occur . I did have some sensitivity even after one strip but my husband has n't had any , but he uses Sensodyne daily . Common sense prevails and always consult your dentist to make sure you can use this product safely . We always get regular cleanings and checkups . We both love the results we are seeing .	1
overall i love the fandango website . the only problem i have is when i select movies in berkeley it only provides one theater ( berkeley ua ) and does not list the other 3 theaters in berkeley . fandango will list the berkeley ua theater and then start listing other theaters outside of berkeley . please list all 4 berkeley theaters together and do not skip to san francisco . thank you .	0

I 've been in Columbia for 13 years . Went to purchase some small parts when they were located on Two Notch . Nearly every time I went there was nobody at the parts counter . Had to wait or else leave without service . Had one repair done years ago and they did an ok job . All Porsche owners seem to take their cars to Docs Grrrage when needing work and that 's what I 've been doing for the past 12 years . I decided to give McDaniels a chance lately as I 've got a defective cigarette lighter that I only use for charging my cell phones / navigation / etc . I called over a week ago and got voicemail in service dept . Left message of problem , what I was looking for , and left phone number . Three days passed . No return call . Called them back on Monday and spoke to service guy . Told him again what I needed and he said he 'd talk with a technician and get back to me . It 's now Friday . No call back . Called again . Got a Sales Rep who said he did n't have time to talk as he was talking with a customer and trying to sell a 100 K car . Complained , so he got his manager . Manager took my name / number / and said the service guy was on his way back and he 'd have him call me . Go figure ! I called Doc 's last week and they got back to me with an estimate in two days . I see all the great and happy reviews from people who 've purchased Porsche 's . I 'm not surprised . They 're great cars . . . . . just when you need to have them serviced is when you see how great the dealer is ! Good luck with McDaniels ! ! ! ! You 'll probably need it .	0
This case broke within in a week . The charging cable connector was difficult to remove from the case iphone once charged .

I returned the case that week .	0

why do you make folks look separately for standard 3d times ? usually , we do n't care but are looking for a convenient time . it makes it twice as confusing to look up each theater individually for 3d and standard . i can understand having them separate for the customers who only want to see one or the other , but why not have the choice of both types , too .	0

I read all the positive reviews online and even contacted the seller prior to making a purchase , these were terrible .First they did not fit my size 9 shoe and I had to cut them down to sizeSecondly the killed my feet .These insoles were hard and made my feet hurt worse than just the shoes alone .I am sad that they did n't offer any suport and dug into the inside of my foot on the right size , these caused me pain like I had never experienced before .The customer service for the seller was great and shipping was fast , but the insoles did not live up to my expectations .	0
This is the biggest rip off Ever . I 'm unable to go shopping right now due to an accident so I thought I would take advantage of this Add On item . It arrived in a very small box and at first I thought they sent the wrong thing but after opening it it 's 12 very tiny rolls of toilet tissue . The inside cardboard roll is about as big . Not a good deal or even a reasonable offer for this , I 'm just out 7 .00 . Check out their ad ons , most of them you can get at Walmart for less . This used to be a good site if you wanted a bargain but not so much anymore .	0
This pair just looked and felt cheap . I was not pleased with these earrings at all . I gave them away for a coworker	0

I buy these all the time . They are usually soft , melt in your mouth and a great substitute for a candy bar . The ones ordered from amazon were stale , but not expired .

The product itself appears to work well . It smells nice . It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth . However , when I looked at the ingredients , I was n't happy . BHT ? Petroleum ? Are you kidding ? ? Not what I want on my body or on my lips . If you do n't mind consuming trace amounts of unhealthy ingredients , then by all means , use this product . I just do n't understand why Nivea chose to use them in the first place . But I have discarded the remainder of mine and will not be using this again .	0

Attention girls over 5'10 This waist cincher is not for you . It 's obviously just not made for tall girls I am 6'1 .

My only complaint is the first bottle I opened has a few gel caps that have leaked . When I open the 2nd bottle and if I have the same problem I 'll change brands . After a week I ended up throwing the 2 bottles I ordered in the trash . The soft gels leaked and they left a nasty after taste after taking .	0
Worst liars in the bizthey lie and in the same breath they show you how poorly they just lied to you . Go elsewhere , unless you like being lied to by a salesman named Paul Park . After failing to deliver the car 3 days in a row , he kept insisting the car is comingwithout actually calling the truck company to make sure . The fourth time , I asked him to call and confirm . But hell no , he wo nt call them b / c he does n't know the name of the trucking company . This is a truck they use every day , but he gets angry saying how is he supposed to know the name of the trucking company ? The idiot later texts me a picture which shows the truck , stamped with LIBERTY TRUCKING . Go elsewhere , unless you like being lied to by a manager named Kevin , who thinks he put your phone call on hold , and then tells his friend hey , give me your cell . I 'm gon na give it to this guy , and when he calls , pretend to be the truck delivery guyand of course , he 's too dumb to put you on hold , so you can hear the entire conversation . Then after cancelling the sale , Paul Park gets angry and suddenly loses the ability to speak in English . He says never to contact him again . But of course , HE keeps emailing you rather than spending his time selling cars . This is 10 days later , and he s still brooding over it like a pubescent tween . And as if this had anything to do with them not delivering your car and lying to you all along , hell harasses you about why you re supposed to speak Korean . This is a 60 yearold who livesand holds a jobin America .	0

This definitely does not work with 4 inch tiles that have grout lines . If a suction cup is attached to one tile , the other cup will be on a grout line and can not get suction ! The description says it works with 4 inch tiles and above without grout lines . I do n't recall seeing 4 inch tiles without grout lines but I suppose there must be some .Beware ! If you have 4 inch tiles WITH grout lines , this does not work ! It seems if this was designed to work with ALL 4 inch tiles and above by slightly changing the length , It would be ideal for almost all 4 inch tiles .	0

Since I have a very wide foot , NB is a regular supplier . I am normally very satisfied . , However , this pair is not live up to either NBs standards or my expectations . The 34N34 on one shoe started peeling backunstitching within two wearings . The strings are undersized and cheap . . .All failures are unique , and not like previous 990s , 993s or 998s that I have bought . After wearing 45 times , I tried to return them to Amazon . Since it was more than 30 day after purchase , they refused . This looks and feels like a cheap knockoff . I am sorely disappointed . If I were NB , I would set up better QC procedures on the factory of origin .	0

This has to be the worst HD dealer in CO . We bought 2 bikes in the same week and yet they gave us no discounts . Had to order my bike . They said 2 days , a week later still no bike . Every other dealership has always given us a great deal or stuff for free . The owner Scott refuses to discount any bike for any reason . The price it is priced at is what you pay . 31k later we love our bikes but will not buy another bike from this dealer . Oh and they flat out lied . Said there was only one bike that I wanted in all of CO . I called the other dealers and found 10 bikes that were the color I wanted . Very very disappointed .	0

I purchased this flip cover from Verizon when I purchased my phone . Within 4 weeks the corners were peeling and the protective backing that sits on the glass was also starting to peel . Its a whole lot of money for only 4 weeks of use .So looking at the warranty paper inside the box I called Samsung . They tried very hard to say they did n't cover physical damage . I informed them that the protective soft side peeling away from the plastic was not physical damage I did , but bad workmanship . It was n't until I demanded to talk to a supervisor and then a manager did they finally decide to replace the flip cover .Here are some photos of our covers only after 2 months of use . . .	0
I tried this as something new instead of a wallet for travel . It is quite bulky in my pocket I noticed it more than my wallet in my front pocket when I would sit down hard corners . It has a pretty aggressive clip that holds the cash well but it is hard to get the money in and out under the clip . I am going back to the wallet .	0

I am not a dentist or in the dental field , but as far as I can tell just my experience with dentist visits , these tools seem to me just like the professionals use . They are not made of cheap metal , they are heavy enough to be able to tell that they are good quality , and the picks and scrapers are very sharp and work well at getting in between your teeth and scraping off tarter . If you are someone who is anal about your teeth and wants to do a little selftreatment at removing tarter at home and in between dental visits , this is a good choice of dental tools and probably as good as you can find outside the dentists office .	1
PROS CONSComfortable inear for allday useMicrophone sound when making a phone call is crystal clear especially compared to a bluetooth headsetMicrophone sound when making a phone call is NOT a substantial improvement over the corded headset / microphone that my phone came withCord is too shortAudio sound quality is not a giant leap forward like most Bose productsThe cord design really stands out / Volume wo n't allow you to turn it up to Your ears will be ringing after listening at this high a volume levels compared to other earphones I 've used with my phoneI'm 6'2 187 cm and like to carry my phone in my back pocket . The cord is about 6 too short to do this without getting jerked out by head movements or putting pressure on my ear doing things like sitting down and standing up . So , I put my phone in my front pocket , which is n't as comfortable and means I have to take my phone out and put it on a table when I 'm sitting down rather than just leaving it in my back pocket .While I know the blackandwhitecandycane cord design is intentionally made by Bose to stand out and make their brand recognizable , it means that if you are going into a meeting and want to leave your Bose headset out in your car I used to leave my headsets in the cupholder , the cord screams to anyone that might be looking for a reason to break into your car I 'm an expensive headset Please steal me ! NARRATIVEI have a Bose stereo and a sound station , too , and have always regarded Bose as a leader in the audiotechnologytosavespace industry . However , I have to say that this product just does n't have the WOW ! factor that the rest of their product line normally has . This is , in part , because this is not a noise canceling headset which I knew before I bought it . However , the clarity of the headset is on par with what you can get for significantly less . I think you 're better off just getting a cheaper replacement headset / microphone with high ratings for comfortable ear buds . . . for about 10 .00 .In other words , if you hear that smack / thud sound while reading this , it is me beating my head against the wall because I made this purchase . I 'm seriously considering returning it .	0

The top cap was digging into my foot and the shoe felt cheap and I could tell it would not last very long under daily use . They were very narrow for D Medium labeled shoes . They look great and are available at a great price , but they very uncomfortable and cheaply made . Avoid .	0

This product seem to calm my digestive system very well . I find that I am wasting a bit of it when mixed with liquid since it does not seem to blend or dissolve very well . Since half a scoop works very well for me and that is all that I take daily , I usually put half a scoop on my tongue and then I would take a sip of water and mix it in the mouth . I 'd rub it in the roof of my mouth and once I feel that it 's all wet and safe to swallow , then I 'd drink more water . I have since ordered this in capsule form for ease of taking it and it also travels better than the powdered form .	1
No Pressure Buying ExperienceLast month I bought a new Nissan Murano from Luis Guizar at Zeigler Orland Park Nissan in Orland Park , IL . The entire process was truly painless . I had been debating buying a new vehicle for at least 3 months but had been putting it off due to my previous car buying experiences and did not really want to deal with the hassle . Working with Luis Guizar was definitely refreshing . His no pressure style in itself was amazing but he also actively engaged in making sure he knew exactly what I was looking for , what I was going to be using the vehicle for and what I needed it to do . He did not try to upsell me to features that I did not need or want . I highly recommend Zeigler Orland Park Nissan and especially Luis Guizar .	1

Before you buy , take a minute to look at the most glowing , positive reviews and then click on the name of the reviewer they only have written one review .

At the time of purchase , the shirt cost me 16 .00 . The small sized shirt fit perfectly I 'm 5'11 and 130 lbs and it looks great . I believe that 16 .00 is quite cheap for a decent shirt so I feel that it is important to mention that I would still have considered purchasing this shirt if it were more expensive . At the same time , the low price tag is what made me consider this shirt in the first place . I have a similar shirt that is from a more expensive brand and cost me significantly more money and this particular shirt actually fit me better and looks better as well . Highly recommended , especially if they are still selling for under 20 .00	1
Takes no more that 30 seconds to load up the brush with this soap . As long as you leave a bit of water in the brush and press down a little on it as your rub the soap , you will have enough for a nice clean shave . Highly recommended . However , there are cheaper soaps out there I am yet to try . Still give it 5 / 5 stars .	1
UPDATE Device failed after one week and after two weeks of contacting support , still no replacement . The tech support was impossible to deal with and I keep being told it 's been sent for escalation and still no working product .These headphones are advertised as bluetooth headphones but they really are n't . Rather it 's a bluetooth to headphone adapter that allows you to use existing headphones semiwirelessly . The lipstick sized adapter clips on your body and then you use existing wired headphones . The microphone and control are on the adapter .In normal use callers could n't hear me unless I held the Play adapter directly to my mouth . Clipping it on my shirt simply did n't provide sufficient call quality . While running , the weight of the adapter banging against my chest was annoying and the call controls were not intuitive and well differentiated for hands free operation . I could n't tell if I was pressing forward or reverse and the buttons had no tactile indicators on them . You had to memorize or look at the controls .If you have expensive headphones you want to use semiwirelessly this adapter is great but if you are looking for an integrated bluetooth solution look elsewhere	0

I started using Proraso when I wanted to try a safety razor . This product can be used with a brush to whip up a great lather . It feels good on the skin and provides a smooth protective layer between your face and the razor . About a year ago I went back to using a disposable razor Gillette Proglide great razor since it was a lot less work and in my opinion , just as good a shave . I continued using this product without a brush . Simply squeeze some out and rub it onto your face . Works better and feels better than the typical foam or gel products that come from a can .	1
Very nice case . We 've taken it off and on a couple times now and it has n't broken yet .

These are by far the best boots that I 've ever owned . All of the other sidezip models fail on me due to my orthopedic condition on one of my ankles that requires my wearing an internal brace . This puts a tremdous amount of stress on the zipper . BUT these boots are amazing . I 've worn them every day without any problems with the zipper , which is proof that these boots are bulletproof . The heals and soles are extremely grippy , and give you a very secure feeling . I 'm a cameraman , and have to carry lights , cameras , tripods , etc . , etc . , across fields with rocks , dirt , mud , grass , etc . , as well as up and down hills and extensive stairs . I 've been on my feet all day today , wearing these boots , and I 'm feeling just great . In short , there is no more extreme case than mine .

the battery charger may be good , and it 's nice that it can charge the phone directly or just a battery externally . buy a spare battery and charge it with this . the light indicates when it is charged .I just realized that my reviews are the closest thing to my immortality . this stuff is already outdated but my words will live on in amazon forever . nobody will be using this device in 10 years hopefully . maybe they will have fuel cells , or body powered devices , or brain implant so you can just stop using blackberry / iphone or maybe I 'll have a personal assistant who carries my blackberry , phone , watch or whatever so I do n't need to bother .

I ca n't believe that this would meet OSHA requirements for a first aid kit . 253 of the 355 pieces are bandaids . Now throw in some pills , a pair of gloves , and you do n't have much left . Yes .

Good batteries I leave tons of reviews on here and I recommend these batteries and the charger is nice to . 1 thing you must know about these batteries when they ship it to you there 's plastic covering the port that connects with your phone so it may seem like the batteries do n't work but they do just remove the plastic .	1

I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism Seems good in theory , but in reality , it falls apart quite literally ! I was very excited about this item , ordered it , and it arrived with the hinges already broken , w / the screws fallen out . Then , because I thought it was just a fluke , I ordered ANOTHER one , and the exact same thing happened , only this time , half of the back side of the lid near the screws go was totally split . So basically , all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return . It 's tempting , but my advice is find something else stay away from this !	0

I thought I could just go without it , however due to the cases ' girth the phones ' own volume rocker is not accessible .In vibrate mode the case rattles a lot . I taped the bottom of the case , however that takes away from the aesthetics and did n't completely eliminate the rattle it is bearable though .Because this case is metal it does lower your signal strength a considerable amount and it bad weather that could mean little or no signal .Lastly , this case adds width to the front / screen of the phone and when trying to move apps from one screen to another it because a little difficult .I have contacted the company for a replacement as I hope this is will fix some of my complaints and I will update my post .As of now , however I would 've loved to recommend this case because it was affordable and very nice looking , however due to the lack of functionally I highly recommend you look elsewhere .	0
As soon as I purchased my new BlackBerry Torch 9800 , I went online and ordered a bunch of Screen Guards protectors . I have a habit of putting my BlackBerry down where my cats can and do . . . walk across it , and they are n't declawed . I 'm already on my second protector . grin I am VERY happy with the level of protection provided , and will continue to use these to protect my Torch . And YES , I do trim nails on my kitties , every two weeks !	1

it is nice to have tickets , and confirmed , ahead of time , . since we get to pay 1 . 75 more per ticket , over mattinee prices , how about helping convince the theaters to discount our treats ? we paid 18 . 50 for 2 med . drinks and one med . popcorn ! its no secret the exhorbitant profit they make at the snack counter . you are providing a good service to us , and them , filling the seats . perhaps you could help bring about a break for the consumer ? after paying 36 . 50 for a movie date with my hubby of 37 years , i am reminded once again why we usually wait for movies to come out on tv . i ca n't say i blame people for bringing in their own treats . thankyou , from 2 people on a fixed retirement income	0

This should be in everyones ' home that is in a stressful environment and it is also good to have on hand for those that come to your house and need to destress . It really works ! You take it as needed . I usually only take 1 capsule every three days or once per week . If you stay stressed out all the time then I would take it every day . It calls for 2 capsules daily but every body 's body is different as well as how they live . It chills you out and does not make you sleepy at all . It allows you to make more rational decisions rather than hasty ones . It works really well ! These people that have road rage issues need some 34Holy Basil34 ! ! ! That 's a fact ! I always keep it on hand for everyone in the family .	1

I bought my first pair of these about 2 years ago . They are on my feet as I type . I adore them . I am a shoe / boot fanatic which I am working on correcting , and out of the MANY shoes that I have , I found myself wearing these everyday as house slippers . I have bought probably every major brands of slippers and I always go back to wearing my fitflop as my everyday slipper . They are so comfortable and seem to get even more so the more I wear them . I have several pairs that I wear as slippers . I wear a size 6 in the fitflop sandals but had to go to a 7 in this style . As much as I love the comfort of these shoes , I 'm not sold on the plain style . So for outdoor clogs I usually wear Dansko or Sanita . I wish theyfitflop made them more stylish . For me , these are WAY more comfortable than Dansko or the many other brands of clogs and I 've tried them all . I would love to wear them outside my home , but I just feel so guilty cause I have so many other choices that look a hundred times better than these shoes that I just ca n't justify wearing them outside the house . I do sometimes were the Gogh Toning Clog patent leather style outside the house they are much cuter to me . But this style is the most comfortable Fitflop of all the ones I 've tried sandals , boots , etc and all the others are REALLY comfortable too . So that 's my 2 cents and have a good day .	1

While the service work was ok , I was very disappointed with the post service support . I had forgotten an important personal item in the loaner call . The sales person , who was very enthusiastic in returning my calls when trying to sell me new tires , was suddenly no longer interested in helping me locate my lost item . I left numerous messages emails to him . I got a message back from the loaner manager with a number , which when I called back does not have a voice mail enabled and the manager never answers . I called service directly and they promised to investigate but heard nothing back . This saga has been going on for 4 weeks now and I am not even sure if anyone has tried to look for my item .	0

I bought this sneakers after reading that people used them for Zumba . In my case , they were very uncomfortable , painful actually . I have quite high arches and these offer no arch support . After , the Zumba class painful 60 minutes of very little leg movement , when I changed into my regular street shoes I was much more comfortable and I was wearing 4 inches heels . In the name of vanity , I have worn very uncomfortable shoes in my life , but I certainly will not wear them even once more .Sizing was a bit weird too , I read that they run small , so I had to order 1 .5 sizes bigger .	0

I have tried many different protein powders over the years , and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone since everyone 's taste is different , I 'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth .I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender , so I rarely have any mixing problems and even this protein mixed well . The fun really began when I tasted it . It tastes sour and acrid at the same time , absolutely horrendous . I could not finish the shake I had mixed up , and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else .This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste , in my opinion . Of all the types I have tried , which is many , this has taken seat as the new worst one .FYI , I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity . If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation , PM me .	0

Likely most of the following you already know however , since many men want to shave in a hurry some of these basic and essential comfort / closeness steps get missed . My recommendation is to take an extra minute or two that will make your shaving experience the best it can be .Prior to using Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion check your electric shaver to ensure is has a good battery charge and the shaver head is clean and functioning correctly .Wash the area of your face where you will be shaving it with a nonirritating facial cleansing lotion / soap . Allow your lathered up shave area to soak for about half a minute or more then rinse completely with warm water this should help soften your beard and clean your skin .Additionally you may want to wet a washcloth with comfortably hot water and hold it against you beard or stubble for a minute or two this should further help soften your whiskers . Pat dry your skin and allow your skin to thoroughly dry if you are in a hurry you may want to try using a blow dryer on a low comfortable setting .Apply an adequate not too much Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion to your completely dry face then , let it thoroughly and completely dry .Shave as recommended by your shaver 's operating instructions and make sure you do not apply too much pressure against your skin to avoid cuts .When you have finished shaving , if the residual fragrance of the Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion is agreeable then you can choose to use an after shave lotion of your selection or not if the Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion is not agreeable with you , you may want to use a warm washcloth to remove the residual lotion from your skin .The Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion bottle indicates the 3rd ingredient after SD Alcohol 40 and Water is Cassava Flour Cassava Manihot esculenta is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae native to South America and is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy , tuberous root , a major source of carbohydrates and , in this case for a primary ingredient in the Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion . Cassava is the thirdlargest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics and is a natural even edible product that is also made into tapioca flour it is a starchy , slightly sweet , white flour . It has been noted that Cubans commonly use cassava to treat irritable bowel syndrome for its calming effects .It appears to me to work well when I only apply an adequate amount not too much . Applying a lavish amount when it dries may produce a thick starchy feel to your skin . Trial and error will help you determine what your best adequate amount is .There are many preelectric shave lotions , powders , oils , and combinations to choose from and in my opinion Mennen Afta PreElectric Shave Lotion ranks in the top 15 to 20 of the products available only you will be able to judge which ones work best for you and your unique skin and whiskers .One final consideration regarding shaving be gentle and thorough allowing an extra minute or two when shaving will produce the most comfortable great shave you can get !	1
Our nearest Costco is more than 100 miles away . It 's a no brainer to buy this from Amazon , even though the price is a bit higher , but with Prime it comes to my door . As a product , this is the basic form of generic Benedryl , in a tablet not a capsule . These taste bitter if you let them linger on your tongue , so it 's best to just gulp them down quickly . I get a great night 's sleep with these , and wake up without nasal congestion .	1
I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon . I 've been a Prime Member since they came up with the program . I do n't even buy anything from department stores without first consulting the Amazon reviews . But over the past year or so I 've noticed a pattern in the reviews more and more of them seem to be fake .I bought this device because of all the glowing reviews . I really wanted it to work because my feet are a constant problem . I 've been using PedEggs for the past couple of years and they work well , but they have to be replaced every couple of weeks and the expense adds up . They also require a lot of elbow grease but my elbows and other parts are not so well greased anymore so I was looking for something a little more automated . From the reviews , this looked great ! Next time , I 'll take a harder look at the source of the reviews . I 've come to distrust all reviews from reviewers who have only one review in their review history . And , all reviewers who have just a handful of reviews but they 're all from the same date . Also , the writing quality of some of the reviews seems contrived .This device was such a disappointment that I am doubtful that all these people could have honestly reviewed it positively . I could n't get it to work for me . My sister could not . My daughter had no luck with it . My neighbor tried it and failed . How the heck are you all getting this to work ? Yes , yes , we know about the light touch thing . The little roller keeps rolling but it just does n't do anything . We tried both rollers , pink and blue . Nothin' .My elderly mother got it to take a tiny dusting of dead skin off but the roller clogged up quickly and no amount of brushing would get it to work again .Should I try glueing sandpaper on the roller like one of the reviewers ? Maybe mine is defective ? I do n't know if it 's worth trying to return it or not . The packaging was accidently thrown out so I doubt if they 'd let me return it anyhow .If you have used this thing and it worked for you I 'd love to hear from you feel free to comment on this . I 'm really curious now and would like to know how many of these 5star reviews were from people who honestly reviewed this based on their own experience .27 Oct 2012 Review Update 1I finally got around to trying out another Emjoi foot buffer . A friend of mine , Ellen , had bought one at the mall a few months ago and she let me try hers . I really wanted it to work . I was so hoping that I could tell you all that the first one was defective and now I 'm a believer . But hers did n't work for me ! Ellen said it did n't work for her either . She had thrown it into a drawer and had n't used it since the first disappointing try . I have yet to meet one person in real life for whom this thing works ! This has me completely flummoxed ! So many of you have been so kind to respond to my review so I 'm a little hesitant to ask for more of your time , but if it is n't too big of an inconvenience . . .would you mind filming your device in action so I can see how you 're getting it to work for you ? I think there 's a place you can add your own images to the product description or you can make a video review . If you do so , please leave me a comment so that Amazon will send me an email so I 'll know when to check back .Thanks again to all those who have been so kind to help me with this ! Pearle18 November 2012 Review Update 2Just a quick note for those of you who have not had much luck with the Emjoi MicroPedi Buffer but also do n't want to go back to PedEggs . I 've found a better solution to my feet problems than the PedEgg . It 's the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp , Microplane Colossal Pedicure Raspand it sells here on Amazon for 14 .87 . It has a nice curved surface which makes it easier to follow foot contours and a long handle for extra reach . Since the rasp surface is larger and the handle is longer it provides more leverage and is a lot better on my arthritic shoulder / arm / hand than the PedEggs .I'm still hoping someone will make a video to show me how they get the Emjoi MicroPedi to work !	0
I have bought three other brands of fleece watch cap in the past and countless beanies , and this is by far my favorite . The price is fantastic , and the biggest thing for me is the fit . Most watch caps I find too short , or other beanies , too long . This is the absolutely perfect fit and length . I have never found a beanie or watch cap that fits better or I like more .	1

Great case ! This case does what some 50 cases do . I was looking for better protection for my Galaxy Note 3 and bought this one because of the kickstand that will allow you to stand the case in both portrait and landscape positions . Most will not do that . The price is awesome and the case is awesome . Plenty of protection , very good feel , great stand . You ca n't go wrong for the money . Got it in two days too with just standard shipping .	1

Wow , I wish they still made appliances like this one . It 's been a real trooper , running and running with no maintenance required .I use the light to prewake me in the mornings , then the alarm feature to actually wake me .My only suggestion for improvement is to make the user interface a little easier to understand when it comes to setting the clock and alarm . I have to break out the manual every so often because I forget which buttons to press at the same time , etc .But I definitely recommend this product in spite of that one nitpick .	1
I saw all the great reviews and awards . Bought pendant , car suction holder and two desk stands , one for home and one for work . Only keeping the desk stands . Non of these will hold a Samsung Epic . All I can guess is that the back of the Epic is slightly curved , so this wo n't fit 100 flush . Tried with an Otterbox protection case on when it would n't work without . Manufacturer says not to use any external casings , so I did n't . Was just trying to find some way to keep the items and a youTube demo had a demo stating you COULD use an external case . Am keeping the desk stands as gravity has a good effect with this in that the stick substance does not have o do 10 of the work in holding the phone . Plus the fact that if i does fall which it has , but not as often it wo n't drop more than a few inches versus 3 feet car mount or 5 feet pendant around neck .	0
I have no idea if i 'd like this because they sent the complete wrong item . It was a kitty head and body , and HUGE . . . It had a red bow instead of pink and is generally not attractive at all .

So I am the type of person that does n't have a whole lot of patience and I do n't have a lot of time to waste . . . that is why I go to Bradley Allen when I need to buy a car . He is the best ! ! Not only is he awesome , but everyone at Covert Cadillac is so friendly and the financial team is on point . When it was time to purchase the vehicle we were in and out in 45 mins ! ! ! No hassle and no unnecessary questions . The truck we just bought is the second vehicle we have bought from Bradley and we could not be more pleased !	1
This shirt looked very cute in the picture . It was very large for a small . I 've ordered other items from this vendor and most of the time the items fit great . The drape is odd and the sleeve holes are really big . It is not an attractive shirt and does n't fit well . I returned it .	0

At least there are no side effects But I might as well have taken nothing . I took it 2 months straight before I gave a review so I could give it a fair shake . I noticed no appetite suppression , and no weight loss whatsoever after 2 months of taking 3 pills 3 times a day weight loss option .	0

Body Core made a great product better with the LINK armband . I 've used theBodyMedia CORE Weight Management Systemsince January . See the product page for my 5 star review . Using this system I 've been motivated to increase my activity level and decrease my junk food level . For me , it 's like having a personal trainer . It makes me accountable . Five pounds of recalcitrant fat gradually disappeared . I 'm also more fit and healthier . None of those high blood pressure or high cholesterol meds for me ! The LINK makes the system more convenient to use .The armband is simple to pair via Bluetooth to my android phone . The application has a few widgets to choose from . Now I can check stats as I exercise and I do n't have to remove the armband to see the results . I ca n't imagine staying up with it so much if I had to connect it to the computer all the time to download . It updates through Bluetooth to the activity manager on the website , and I can input the nutrition info during the day . Now , my BodyMedia personal trainer stays with me all day .BodyMedia made an excellent product even better with the LINK .	1
Apparently 30 billion probiotic bacteria is the right number to keep my digestive system moving along without a hitch . I 've tried a variety of other brands , and do n't even know what motivated me to search out this product . The difference I find with this product is consistent , uniform , rhythmic results . I think the packaging , while attractive is wasteful since the bottle of capsules occupies less than half of the box pictured . Perhaps they might find room for a second bottle in the box and pass along the savings to the consumer .	1

I went to Sam 's Club to buy a Seico watch I have had two of them and liked the one I saw except it did n't have the luminous hands I liked . I was going to buy it anyway but when I tried it on my wrist , there was no way the clasp would work . I asked the saleslady if she had another one and she ' sighed ' and went to a cabinet and found one . I tried to get the clasp on this one to work and it was the same as the first . She finally got it to hook , but not while on my wrist . By the way , I was already irritated with her long , decorated and embelished purple fingernails and her attitude . I finally gave up and left . When reading the reviews I see that I am not the only one who had problems with the clasp . One ' expert'said the size of the clasp and the hook did not match up . So I am off to find another brand and goodbye to Seiko	0
rewards program inquiry hello . i was hoping to add my rewards info . to my acct . from the movie i saw yesterday , but unfortunately i did n't have my rewards card at the time of purchase . this is for regal rewards program btw . curious why there is not a way a customer can add rewards points against the purchase ticket , via an onsite link on fandago ( vs . having to take the stub back to the movie theater , which usually , i forget to do ) . please have your developers consider providing a capability to somehow associate movie ticket info , to our online acct . info after having signed in . would make our ( customers ' ) lives so much easier being able to add any outstanding rewards points to our acct . via online ( vs . theater or phone ) method . thanks for listening !	0
Only Lexus dealership that I 've been to that requires an appointment to drop off a car for service . Told me next available opening is 10 / 12 / 2017 more than a week from toady . I 've decided to drive all the way to Chantilly Pohanka Lexus because of this ridiculousness . Have owned Mercedes , BMW , and another Lexus before but first time hearing you need an appointment a week in advance for service .

Warning The spray brush sprays about 18 out to each side . Nothing but dribble comes out under the brush , where you need it . I bought it to clean two area rugs , 5'x7 ' and 6 ' octagonal . I 've sprayed the hardwood floors and the new Ethan Allen spotcleanonly furniture ! in my attempts to clean the 5x7 rug . I am soaked in spray as well . No liquid appears to be pulling back into the discharge tank , although I followed the written instructions .

The blade it came with cuts extremely well and for that I 'm satisfied . Having the option to buy other attachable blades is wonderful if you know what you 're looking for .

i received a fandango gift card for the holidays . the first time i used it , i was surprised to see a deduction fee for convenience . i have to tell you , your site is not convenient , it is a pain in the butt . the second time i tried to use the site , there was a convenience fee and i kept getting thrown off the site and missed the time for the movie i wanted to see . i am not a fan and i would never give one of your gift cards to someone . when you buy the gift card from the theater , you get to use the full amount and you pay at the window . now that is convenient .	0

Had scheduled an oil change and new tires ! When i arrived , there was a miscommunication about whether or not I was going to have the tires changed on my visit ! The tires that were suppose to be at Kia for me were n't there . BOB the rep who has assisted me before , mentioned they were put on a car the day before ! Have to respect his honesty , a bit frustrated because i now had to wait for another set to be delivered ! Bob , gave me a loaner car to go and run my errands . Which was very considerate and I appreciated able to run my errands with set back ! At the end of the day i was VERY happy with the service and will be back for my next oil change ! Thanks BoB for being awesome !	1

four of us attended the movie lincoln at the regal theater in carmel in last evening . it is insane that we had to sit with coats , gloves and scarfs on throughout the long movie , due to the frigid temperatures inside . it was so uncomfortable that it took the joy out of watching the movie . just a smattering of heat , then the cold air was on again . this is winter , turn off the air conditioning . i tried to enter this comment on the regal website , but it is closed . please pass this on to someone who is in charge . thanks .	0
An acquaintance won a bike from them then were taken for over 7 , 000 in service contracts . Due to a social media blitz of outrage , they finally caved and cancelled the service contracts they wielded unto them while intoxicated and unable to understand what they were signing . I know hundreds of people in the biking community with awful things to say about this shady dealership and it is obvious they delete bad reviews . I expect mine will not last through the day . Boo ! UPDATE Due to social media blowback , this company set things straight with the couple who won the bike . They were only required to pay the tax . The contracts they were wrangled into were voided . Many biker Facebook groups made all the differences in this case but Avalanche . HE has a history of shoddy work and poor customer service . They hate doing warranty work and their priority is on bike sales and very little service afterward . I 've read horror stories about not fixing bikes properly and not standing behind their product . I would go elsewhere .	0

Top notch . . . Could n't be happier . First new car we 've bought in MANY years .	1
When I opened the package , I was greeted with a tag in large letters warning that this urethane foam pillow is highly flammable . It went on to say that once ignited , it would be very hard to extinguish , even with water . And the fumes could be toxic .Then I was greeted with a strong , irritating and noxious odor . After airing out for several days I thought I 'd give it a try . The odor never disapeared completely , and weeks later when I rolled over on it I 'd get an unpleasant whiff that would sometimes wake me up .The pillow did tilt me up so my sinuses drained better and it was a little easier to breath at night . However , the tilt vectored the weight of my upper body down along my spine and onto my lower back and hips . They became painful and sore as the night progressed , and in every position my back and legs would become painful enough to wake me up .I gave it a couple of weeks , but my sleep and the pain only got worse . If it helped me sleep I 'd still be unhappy because of it 's flammability and nauseating smell .It arrived in a highly compressed form held tight by plastic wrap . There 's no way to compress it back and return it , so now I 'm stuck with a stinky , ugly , and useless pillow . And I do n't want it around because of its flammability . Maybe I can cut it up and throw it away in stages . . . .	0

It 's often difficult to find a product of this sort that does n't contain artificial ingredients AND is reasonable in price however this one not only is very reasonably priced but also is nonGMO , halal , and uses organic olive oil . I want more of my supplements to be this good ! The softgel is small and easy to ingest , and the dosage of bioaccessible D3 is a good , high level .The only caution I 'd mention is that it is lanolinderived , which only is problematic for those with a sensitivity to lanolin . For the many of us who do n't have lanolin sensitivity , however , this is a great product !	1

i like fandango , but i am afraid that you might be in danger of losing on of your major pluses . i recently purchased a ticket for opening day of les miserables . i did this specifically because i was worried the show might sell out which it did . i arrived at the theater to pick up my tickets and was informed that the show was sold out . only after protesting , did they allow me into the theater where i did find a seat , still , it gives me pause . i have always used fandango to purchase tickets on opening days specifically to ensure i will not go only to find the show sold out . if the theater will not honor the ticket purchased through fandango for the designated show , it loses a lot of its appeal .	0

I bought a X3 from Century BMW but will not buy from Century BMW again . Terrible experience . I was rushed into a deal without proper explanation of the vehicle . Came to find out the vehicle had a chipped paint spot right after I signed the paperwork that could n't be repaired at the dealership . I brought up my concern and requested the paint spot to be fixed at a body shop . The New Car Director laughed at me and thought it was funny . Both General Sales Manager and the same New Car Director were impolite in the email . At the end they gave me an ultimatum but without truly addressing my needs . After the ultimatum I emailed back again and never heard a word from them . I filled out the survey two weeks ago and still have not heard anything from them . Century BMW is all about sales , once they get you signed the paper work , they stop listen to you . Forget about having the passion of finding the customer the best BMW or taking pride in making the purchase a wonderful experience or assuring the customer having the highest level of customer service as claimed on Century BMW 's staff page . Reading these staff bios make me sick . All they are interested is squeezing every single penny from you then kick you out of the door . I am a customer of Century BMW for 8 years , their service department is great but DON'T buy from them . I rather drive 1 . 5 hours to buy from from another BMW dealership then drive 10 minutes to Century BMW and get disrespected .	0

Waste of time to the Nth degree . The sales guy Casey Tibbs was fine . However , a juniorlevel mistake bringing out the sales manager to talk to a customer already less than impressed with the product was a tacky move to make . I did n't request to speak with a manager I just wanted to go about my day . They do n't take No for an answer when a customer says a vehicle is n't for them . Instead H H 's poor attempt to defend their product twists into blaming the customer 's taste . I 'm most definitely buying a Volvo S90 over the Kia K900 due to the tasteless sales manager 's demeanor . I doubt most customers would disagree with methis place deserves its low rating .	0

I ordered this and it arrived in a few days . I opened the package and it came with a few parts to put together , I was dash mounting this so I used all the parts . I cleaned off the dash with the supplied alcohol pad and stuck the sticky base on and it went right on fast . I then mounted the holder and I had a few problems getting it to stick correctly , but when I did get it it went right on . I snapped the actual phone holder onto the base and stuck the droid in . It went right in and immediately went into car mode . The face was sliding and dipping all over the place until I realized I had to tighten it all with the knobs and when I did the thing was perfect .Some people are saying they got one without the car charger but mine did come with the rapid car charger but I do n't think I would ever use it . I have a USB splitter I use in my lighter than I can plug pretty much anything into that has a USB connection and the splitter has 2 slots . I would call and say it did n't come with a charger if you need it and I am sure you can get one .Overall I highly recommend this mount , I am not disappointed .	1

1 ) almost every movie gets 4 stars ( plus or minus a half a star ) . . . that is so not helpful and totally untrue . i think users would appreciate something more truthful or just get rid of them . 2 ) with the stars , making it orange instead of gray is not easy to see . . . not enough color contrast , especially if there is a half star involved . you 'd be better off making the stars just an outline and fill them in as appropriate with orange .	0
I was so tickled to receive this bracelet ! The peridots are a lovely shade of celery green and the citrine are the color of a butterscotch candy . I especially love the look of the spacers , which look like little snowflakes or stars . The catch is unusual , sturdy , and secure . It took me a few minutes to figure out how to open the catch ! The fit is good , with about 1 / 2 to half an inch gap all the way around when fastened . I 'll be posting pictures as well . This feels like a quality piece of jewelry and it certainly looks it as well .	1
Horrible experience with a sale person Artie . He came to my dad and i nicely , once I mentioned I wanted to lease a i3 for my 3rd car but I want to try it out first . But what he wants is talk about money before giving me an i3 to try . I feel like he is not a good salesperson to me .	0

I 'm not sure what 's going on with this place but I was interested in a vehicle and noticed the car was literally 7 , 00013 , 000 over Kelly Blue Book value range . I thought it was a mistake and I called to make sure and sure enough the price was correct . I tried to figure out why it was priced so high and they failed to provide a reasonable explanation . With that said , I would avoid this dealership unless you are looking to be ripped off , they should be embarrassed to list a car above KBB and should really know better . Perhaps their buyer overpaid for the car or they are trying to make a significant amount of money , either way they are flat out wrong and should reduce the car to market value .	0

what happened to biltmore 15 ? your app used to include this theatre and now it 's missing . if the app does n't list all the theaters then it loses it 's usefulness .	0
I was very hesitant in bringing my BMW e46 m3 in for a recall because I 'm afraid of tech 's damaging my car . My car is in very good condition and I take very good care of it you can tell by looking at it inside and out as most have been replaced with brand new factory parts . But since it 's an airbag recall I decided to bring it in for safety purpose . I get my car back and they tell me the tech scratched my steering wheel trim . I tell them they should replace the trim with new part and they agreed . Heather , who inspected the damage was very kind and told me the new part has been ordered . I live over an hour away and had to come back to get my trim replaced the following week . They replace my trim and I went on my way . As soon as I get home I notice scratches and scuffs in my driver door handle as if they opened the handle with the keys in their hand . I know it was from the dealer because I inspected my car thoroughly before bringing it in . My mistake was not checking the outside of my car before leaving the dealer I checked the interior only , as it was where the repair was done . I 'm very upset with how my car was treated initially and the second time . The techs that worked on my car were very careless and reminded me as to why I did n't want to bring my car in the first place . Just want to let you know my experience and why I will never be coming back to your dealer again .	0
I use a lot of ginger in my diet because it helps me to digest food and stay away from indigestion . I had taken Prylosec for 7 years and decided to get off of it because I was concerned about prescription medications made in labs going into my body . I learned that ginger benefits your digestive system . I use New Chapter because I trust them to sell me a product that is all natural and does not contain the added 34junk34 that many alternatives have . While taking this product I found that I did not have indigestion . Bottom line it helped me to get off of presciption medication .	1
Just as described , and works great . This is much cheaper than going through my sleep doctor and fits just as expected .	1
Be aware of this product .It 's not real Samsung product . I ordered 4 cables and every serial numbers are the same .It 's a really faked one and may break your phone .The pin is too tight and if you use this too long time , your phone 's usb jack would not fit to any other genuine Samsung USB cable .Shame on Hongkong ! I 'm going to claim now ! Update 5 / 4 / 12 Got an email from seller and they refunded full amount but I keep the one star review because of faked one useless .	0
I have had several unpleasant experiences with Audi Plano . My first negative experience is when I brought my Audi in to utilize the wheel protection plan that I had purchased when I bought the car . I was told that the wheel protection covered any damage to the wheels except caused by curbs . Well , to my dismay , the finance gentleman performed a bait and switch on me because Audi would not fix the wheel unless their was catastrophic damage to the wheel . I have learned my lesson and will thoroughly read those lengthy contracts before agreeing to paying additional thousands of dollars for unusable service programs . Very unfortunate and disheartening that a company would be so dishonest . My next negative experience is also related to an optional service program that I purchased from Audi . I had purchased the door and dent protection and was told that it would cover door dings and alike along the side of the car . This is partially true , however , if the dent is too high ie . near the bottom of the window it is not covered . My last negative experience I would like to share is when I brought my Audi in to be serviced for some issues that were occurring . Audi was unable or unwilling to discover or fix the issues my car was having . The initial technician told me everything was normal which most definitely was not the case . I escalated to various managers who attempted to give me various possibilities for the issues but were still unwilling or unable to fix my car . Audi had my car for 4 business days and now I still have a new car with issues . I will definitely not be returning to this dealership or probably any other Autonation dealership if this is how they all operate . Note Please read the negative reviews here . I am not the only one having a lackluster experience with this dealership !	0
I have almost all these colors , but this color , olive , is a different lenght and no built in bra .The name of the top is Panini , and it comes very short , just below belly button . I have almost all the colors and everyone is a Zenana but this one . Was not as described at all . Huge disappointment but not worth the money to return . Buyer beware	0
I had an older one of these that I got from somewhere else , and this one was nowhere near as good . the foam was stiffer and it slid all over the floor , it just did n't work .	0

Let 's just say I should have gone somewhere else . I purchased a supposedly new car there this past Thursday . First of all , I went there to see about the purchase of a used car . Got talked into a new one . . . not bad that , because most everything I 've been looking at lately already had at least 75 , 000 miles on it and for a used car , that is A LOT . In any event , I ended up with the new car , no MSRP sticker was provided on the window that I remember and I feel I should have at least gotten a sticker or something which shows a blow by blow itemization of exactly WHAT is on my car . I have since asked for this sticker but no one has gotten back with me yet . Bad experience for my first new car purchase . Oh well , live and learn for me , but hope someone else can benefit from my bad experience . If I ever get anything else out of these people that 's favorable , I may be able to give them a better rating , but for now ? I can only give one star , at the most . Meanwhile , I 'd try to steer clear of this one !	0

First , let me say I am a gizmo freak , I love electronic toys . Home automation off my Apple toys are my addiction , so I am always trying new stuff , always searching for new stuff . These are a brilliant idea . It seems like a good concept . I tried to like these , but , dang ! ! I have six of the stickr trackRs and two wallet trackRs . First thing is the distance . I leave these in my bedroom and move the iphone 5s into the livingroom and all of them go off . . .over and over and over , even though they are turned off inside the app . The next issue is how they kill the battery . Generally my iphone runs 68 hours texting and calling with no problem . Since I installed these , in three hours my phones battery is at 35 . This has been a daily occurrence since I installed them . Even with them supposedly turned off in the app , and my Bluetooth on the phone turned off , they constantly show that they are 34connecting34 . So the app is running in the background HARD , trying to connect . The connection range is a real problem with these . I can leave my phone in my bedroom and move all through my house and still talk clearly with my jabra headset , so I know I have plenty of Bluetooth signal inside my house . The app says you can connect TEN of these , this is a real problem if you are n't carrying all ten items with you . If you put one in your wallet and one on your keys and the others in various other items , and leave the house with two of them , the others you left at the house will constantly search for a signal . . .eating up your battery life . Also , as soon as you are out of range , they alert , the things themselves beep , incessantly . Even with all their alerts off . Which upsets the dog , and irritates everyone still in the house . None of the eight will sound an alarm on the phone , all it get is a volume icon and a 34trackR separated34 notification . I can press the button on the things and nothing sounds on my fone . I tried a line of sight test at my house and the best straight line I can get is about 25 to 35 feet before they start beeping . The wallet trackR gives the better signal , probably because they are bigger and may have a better antenna ? The strings that hold the sticker trackRs onto key rings etc actually good old fashioned phone charm holders available right here on amazon fit into little notches on the rim of the trackR . If they get hung up on anything , like inside your pocket , they pull loose . Great . Finally had to put a drop of super glue on them to keep the trackR from falling off and wandering off at least they are easy to find when you press the alert in the app . Their delivery stinks . I order two , took them 3 weeks to send me a tracking / shipping number . I was ok with that , it was in the order instructions . What got me was they did n't actually make it to the post office until SIX days later . . .and they showed up at my house another six days later California to Florida . Three weeks to ship and two weeks to deliver ? ? When I wrote the company and voiced my complaints , I got an email back about returning them for an EXCHANGE . Exchange ? Wow , thanks . They seem to spend more time marketing than making a product that actually works . They do n't seem to have a lot of focus in what they are doing . Since they came out with their upcoming BRAVO model I have been inundated with a never ending onslaught of confused offers , counter offers , buy one get one free , buy one , like us here or there , get another free , on and on . When they announced them , I immediately ordered two . That was before I found all these problems with this batch . Of all the iphone add on devices I have tried , I HATE these . I really wish I had not gotten involved with them . Usually I buy something , I try it , if I do n't like it , ok , I tried it , it did n't work for me , or , I write the company and they work with me to make it work . Honestly , since I gave up blackberry for apple , I have n't been disappointed in anything , or any company I dealt with . These things , right from their marketing , design and customer service are horrible , and so easy to hate everything about them , and pretty much everyone associated with them . I have to go to the store , I am deleting the app from my fone and pulling the batteries out of all eight of these stupid things so I can leave peaceably and quietly and not upset the dog . Phone Halo I hate you .	0
At first I was a little reserved about this product , I still thought I should give it a try . The delivery was quite fast to be honest , was n't really expecting it that fast . I still had some questions regarding the garcinia cambogia extract so I thought it will be better to ask some questions before I start taking the pills . Every single question of mine was well answered and backed up with facts by the customer service department . And here I am 2 weeks later I 've lost 14 lbs , it is not a miracle , but I am not expecting miracles , I want an effective and working diet pill and that is what I got .	1

Wow this stuff works . I had been taking Mother 's Milk Plus as a supplement to increase my milk production . It sort of worked . I took it in conjunction with More Milk tea , and I found that between the two of them , it did increase milk production . Not as much as I would like , but enough to get us by . However , this fenugreek supplement is powerful enough that just two of these per day got me the same results as using the Mother 's Milk Plus and the More Milk tea . I 'm impressed at the results as opposed to a similar product . If you are struggling with your milk supply , I 'd urge you to give this fenugreek product a try .I have still needed to supplement with formula , but I 'm using less formula with this product than I was with the other two products , which speaks well to my production .	1
We got these from another store and they are cute and nice and colorful . They also totally stick to the paper , and you ca n't get the paper pulled off . You pull one off and the paper sticks to the back like it 's glued on . Better packaging would easily fix this problem .	0
Jonathan was great . He knew exactly what to do when I came in looking for a car . He listened carefully and knew quickly how much of a car I could afford and worked hard to get the payments just right for me . Then he took the time to show me all the things I needed to know about my car . I highly recommend Jonathan and Murdock Hyundai .	1

This shaver provides a decent shave and , with its water shutters , is easier to clean than other shavers which require you to pop off the cover .Although it 's wet / dry , I 'd recommend using it dry , unless you 're using an electricshaver gel , which acts differently from shaving cream it stands the hair up instead of softening it . If you 're using it dry , do it over the sink to catch those little hair remnants .If your beard is a little long , use the trimmer first , then go over it with the screen .Depending on your face contours , you may need to go over the area a couple of times . This is standard for these kinds of shavers .	1

I read the reviews about some of these being fake , but I figured that I would be safe because the case was sold and shipped by Amazon . I was wrong . Amazons price was 113 . That was only 12 less than the Lunatik site , so I figured that it would be authentic . WRONG ! The case arrived quickly , but its packaging was falling apart and did not look like the packaging of the real one . I knew right away that it was the fake one that is all over the Internet and can be bought for about 30 . The bezels were made from poorly cast aluminum with casting marks all over them and a cheap black paint job . The Lunatik branding was painted on instead of stamped into the case . The builtin glass screen protector was poorly glued in and I highly doubt it was Gorilla Glass . It also had a very bad 34oil slick34 effect . The rubber inner part was very flimsy and did not fit the phone very well . The camera cutout was one opening instead of individual openings for the flash , camera lens and noise canceling mic . The bottom flap did not stay closed either . The material that is supposed to be water resistant that covers the speakers looked like some kind of cheap cloth instead of Gortex . The front bezel cut out for the earpiece , light sensor and front facing camera is also different . I believe Amazon is knowingly selling these , because when I requested to return it , my credit card had been credited back the full amount before I even sent the package back . Amazon is great with the returns , but I have never received a refund until after they received a product back .I ended up ordering the real one directly from Lunatik . I received quickly and it was packaged very well . The real case is outstanding and worth every dime it cost . Shame on Amazon for selling a cheap imitation . I may have to consider renewing my Prime account next time around .	0

I see many glowing reviews on this case and I am mystified . Do you want a case that fits very loosely on your phone that is likely to start coming off in your pocket ? Do you like it when you try to push the power button or volume but instead push the case right off the side of the phone ? If you do then this is a great case .The case is loose on the sides . The way the rubber is , it just does n't wrap the sides tight , so most often the front face sides are exposed . The thin piece of rubber over the volume rocker and power button are super loose and flimsy and gets caught on everything whether in a bag or in your pocket . I purchased 3 of these after all the great reviews and returned all three of them after trying them on several phones .What could make this case better1 . A little tighter case , maybe stiffer plastic along the sides so it actually covers the phone .2 . No cutouts for the volume and power buttons . I think this would strengthen the sides along with removing loose flimsy rubber that snags everything .	0

I was recommended this product off Good Looking Loser and figured I 'd give it a try . It is a little expensive for a small can of powder , but since I use only half a scoop with my coffee every morning , it lasts a long time .

I would not purchase these again . I have tried to use them several times but they do not work well . The tip design does n't work very well , seems to collect the stain instead of clearing the stain . The tip is a round flat area not useful for rubbing the stain nearly the size of a dime . The pen can not compare to the tide pen or other brands I have used .	0

I stopped in on a Saturday , It was about 30 minutes before closing time . I was in market for a used 2014 C300 , I was shopping for a few weeks and pretty much was looking at 2630k price range for a low millage Certified preowned . I decided since I checked Fairfield , No Haven , and New Country I should at least take a quick drive to this dealer . The previous week I spent a few days chatting with sales and a sales manager here on a Silver one with AMG wheels . I wanted a certain wheel package They had one in stock low miles with package I wanted price was a little high but I figured we can chat about that later . The first sales person told me car was sold , so I did n't go down that day . Next day I see it on another website call was told it is available I wanted to discuss price over phone since it was a drive for me they said no have to come down . Call Saturday to see if car is available I was told yes , I drive 67 miles to see it , it was sold week ago . I was annoyed sales person says hey no worries we have lots of cars . This day they had 3 C300s 2014 I do n't know if normal or not but they did n't have much in 14 low miles . I Saw one I liked it was a 14 , had 39k miles on it most options , no zenons and wheels I liked it was a dark metal They were asking 31999 . 00 at the time most of the 2014s similar features were 2799929999 at most dealers with over 30k miles . I saw a few at 3132 but they had miles under 20k . I mention to sales person price seems hi He says We sell lots of cars it ca nt be that bad I show him on phone app 9 cars in CT same body type etc in CT certified at MB dealers all under 29k . He says the price is what it is . I am glad it was I drove to New Country and bought the same car with 14k miles for 29 . Dealer closer to me and no attitude from sales they actually negotiated a little bit , got a few services as well . This dealer acted like they were special . Make matters worse I asked him If I can test drive a new coupe because I was considering maybe going new when I saw the new coupes . He laughed said come back next week we close in 30 mins . WOW I am in sales too . . . No clue what his problem was . I was dressed down that day but I did pull in with my BMW . If you ca nt take a customer pointing out your prices are high ? do n't be in sales . I emplore you if your looking at a car here , Call New country or NorthHaven both are more competitive and sell more cars .	0

I 'm afraid this product did not produce the desired results I expected . It was a very strange effect . I was eating less but gaining weight at the same time . What the heck is that ! I 'm convinced these caps made the difference because I was not taking anything else to account for the change . In fact , I was following the Atkins diet which caused me to lose weight in the past . I 'm glad it works for some but in my case it did n't . Bummer !	0
I bought a Infiniti a week ago and the service was horrible . The salesperson was inexperienced and his customer service skills were subpar .

I will not be making any purchases from International Auto in the future .	0

Here 's the deal We have ordered these before , They 're a decent , fair priced pj . These are listed as SHORT sleeve , so I ordered them . I received LONG sleeve . These are FULFILLED by Amazon but Amazon is not the vendor , so it was a HUGE hassle to get an exchange arranged . They do n't let you handle it online , nice snd simple , you have to CALL someone . First , my customer service rep spoke very broken English , so there was a communication problem . But after over 15 minutes , I was under the impression that we understood each other . This was a simple exchange long sleeve for short sleeve . Like , in the description ? It 's HOT in Florida , you try to sleep in long sleeves . One week later , I get a package from Amazon . They sent me THE VERY SAME PAIR OF LONG SLEEVED PAJAMAS . I just do n't get it . After all of the BS I had to deal with and then receive the same error ? Not happy . So guess what ? I still have a set of LONG sleeved pajamas in the package . And that 's where they 'll stay . I just can not handle another one of those phone calls . Buyer beware of 34Fullfilled by Amazon34 exchanges	0

I travel just to get to this dealership and they certainly are worth my drive and time . Leslie too , very pleasant and patient . She took her time to show me how to use all the extras in my vehicle . All are one of a kind , super special team . Keep up the great work .

Did n't feel a thing , no change , nothing . I was only expecting to skip snacks with the help of this . I already eat less , only have 10 pounds to loose but I was hungry by 11 am as usual . I reviewed so many products online and decided on this because there were many good reviews from verified purchasers but I guess it varies by person . I just got Mangodrin from GNC today , the good part about buying from a store is you get 30 day money back guarantee . If it does n't work , you just take it back and try another one . Everybody is different and it takes a while to find what works for you . Even picking a simple multivitamin takes trial and error . So good luck !	0

Amazon has Free Return Shipping on Jewelry , which is why I was willing to try this . Unfortunately , although a larger chain would fit this , my chain was too large .It is , however a pretty piece and I was hoping I could wear it with both silver and gold figaro chains but my silver figaro would n't fit . If my chains had fit , I would be very happy with it .With Amazon 's policy of FREE return shipping on jewelry , it is not so scary to try something .	1

What you have to be careful is that there are THREE 3 layers to each protectorImagine staring at the protector from the sideFront Protector Protector BackWhen i first tried applying , I thought there were just two layers . That layer I was trying to apply to the phone was just the protective backing for the screen protector itself . Stupid me . . .Do check out some youtube videos before you install this screen protector , in the case this is your first time ! Besides that hiccup in the application , the protector is good quality , glasslike in clarity .All I can stress is be careful , patient , and make sure to use the provided cloth to make sure you clean the surface of your phone very well .	1
you need to expand your movie search functionality . you 're really good at telling me that a particular movie is n't playing near my city . ok , so where the fuck is it playing ? i might be willing to drive 25 or 50 miles to see a movie . do i have to enter every zipcode for 50 miles and pray to find a match ?	0
After seeing other great reviews and wanting a case for my iphone that was smaller than the steel cage i was keeping it in , i decided on this one .Let me say it is perfect . It is a good size , covers the phone well , and looks great . It definitely compliments the iphone rather than dominates it . My wife likes it enough to forgo her coach case for this case .	1
Love spirulina . Lots of nutritional qualities and this one is supposedly clean of contaminants , so that is why I get this particular brand . Give some to my dogs also because it is good for them too . You can look it up online at Wikipedia .org to learn all about it . I try to avoid any supplements from China , due to their very poor record for contaminated products .	1

Walked in just wanting to test drive a car . I was shown a basic and a decked model . In the market for a 7 seat Rogue . There were none on the lot . Manager said they could get one . Before I left I asked for some estimate numbers for price range and they could nt even do that they mentioned without even getting the car . There was no effort into helping me or even wanting to look into finding the car while I was there . Bad business very pushy they did nt want to sell a car . Will not go here again . The sales rep did nt hardly know anything about the car . On my test drive he drove half way . The practice here is not well . Will be shopping elsewhere .	0
i was emailed on three separate occasions informing me that iron man 3 tickets were on sale , but when i went to check the website , i discovered they were n't . frustrated , i did n't immediately respond to the fourth alert i got , resulting in my missing out on purchasing iron man 3 tickets for opening weekend . this all happened before regal amc decided to stop selling advanced tickets , so do n't bring that up .	0
Outstanding ExperienceI was looking for a specific year and model . . . BMW 4 Series hardtop convertible . They are very difficult to find and there was not one at the Dealership .

I am returning these boots . They fit well and are made well , but I do not like the top where the zipper ends . There are still several inches of boot to go , and it is held together by a little strap . Since I planned to wear these over skinny jeans , it just looks funny where it does n't come together well . If that does n't bother you , they are great boots . But it sure did bother me . /	0

a service charge of 2 . 50 to use a fandango gift card is robbery ! i 'm so glad i checked the usage before distributing theses cards to my employees . i will return all fandago gift cards this company is a ripoff !	0
I almost did n't purchase these because the photo shows . . . printed on the case . However , the six I received were blank no printed web address , so I am very happy . There is a POWEREX logo molded into the cover , but it 's the same color as the entire case , so not too noticeable .These are the best battery cases going . Ten bucks for six cases seems a little steep for cheap plastic cases , but that seems to be the going rate and these are the best quality thickness and type of plastic in my opinion . I researched battery cases just the cheapies , not the waterproof ones that cost over fifteen bucks for a single case for about a week before purchasing these .I prefer a case that holds 8 batteries to the smaller ones that hold only four , and I think the rigid 8 cell case is much better than snapping two smaller 4 cell cases together . Perhaps just a personal preference , but I think the case is stronger and the higher capacity just makes more sense .The plastic is thick , but flexible enough to not shatter too easily like some other cases .The AA fit is nice and snug , with no movement whatsoever , and the AAA fit is good as well placed horizontally instead of vertically with just a little space at the top and bottom . 8 AAA 's still leave a space in the center for two more AA 's you could also place two more AAA 's instead of the AA 's for 10 AAA 's total , but the AAA 's will rattle around a little bit when oriented like the AA 's .Of course the little plastic tabs that keep it closed will fail at some point , but once that happens I 'll probably just use a rubber band . That said , these cases are identical to a case that came when I ordered a set of Eneloops more than a year ago , and that case is still going strong .	1

This taste Terrible . I have other company WHEY that taste better . This taste like I am eating grain and old chocolate . I got the double rich chocolate terrible flavors . Also this immediately sinks to bottom has no mixing in water . I will go back to other company . I found the brand at walmart taste much better .Update 6 / 1 / 2013I gave this to my father he said it was n't bad he liked it so must be me . I guess everyone has their own taste . He also mixes things in his blender which I do not .	0

It does n't fit well lower waist is a bit too tight , around the hip is little too big . . . but i was thinking of keeping it anyway coz it might stretch or whatever but when i saw the back and noticed that the horizontal stitching . . is crooked and the positioning of the belt loop in the middle is actually NOT in the middle , i decided to return it . . not sure if it 's defective or most of them are like that . . . this is after i got an exchange coz the last one was too small . . do n't remember the back of the smaller one . . . i fit size medium or 3 in Almost Famous brand . . this one is NOT a keeper unfortunately . .	0
This stuff tastes really good . I use it in my coffee and I use a little bit of it in my oat bran in the morning . It 's incredibly potent so use drops and count them as you use them .One thing I do n't like is that the cap gets all sticky due to the drops running down it . I wish there were a more efficient way of doing it . Maybe an eye dropper of some sort ? Tastes great and contains no extra ingredients .	1

I have been struggling with plantar fasciitis pain for almost a year . It started in my arches , but eventually it progressed into being constantly tender heels . I bought the night splints , the arch supporting elastic bands , and the supportive socks . I iced my feet and rolled my feet on tennis balls . I even stuck to wearing shoes with serious arch support . No luck with any of that . However , this arrived three days ago , and I have been using it twice a day . So far , I am very optimistic . My pain has been less and less each day , including when I wake in the morning . I will be sad if I have to replace it I read all the reviews where the fabric wore out . But if it helps me get rid of my pain , I will buy another one if I have to !	1
a whole lot foul , freaky and funny	1
I am fairly active and train 6 days a week . Whether it 's running , weight training , martial arts , or sports , I often have sore joints and muscle aches . In the past I 've used Icy Hot , Bengay , and Aspercreme but recently I tried Biofreeze which was offered at my chiropractor . Although Biofreeze , like the other brands provide only temporary pain relief , it is by far the most effective one and longest lasting . It is of a gel texture unlike Aspercreme and Bengay . I am beginning to make it a habit of applying Biofreeze a little to much because it does feel nice and cold and should stop using it unless I absolutely need it but nonetheless , Biofreeze is extremely effective in temporarily relieving sore muscles and joints .	1
These are the worst . Every time I grab one to use the applicator has been push through and I have to carefully shove the tampon back into the thing before I can insert it which its quite difficult and has to done in a certain fashion so the string is in the right place .

They have beautiful cars . However , you can get the same car from a MercedesBenz dealership on the other coast for a much better price . I recently did this with a 2014 CLS 550 . 10 , 000 less miles , two years newer , more options . Saved a few thousand dollars From MercedesBenz of Fort Lauderdale on federal highway . It 's not just Mercedes . . . all the luxury dealerships are marked way up here on the West Coast On preowned certified vehicles . I had the car delivered to my doorstep for 100 . They also do n't treat you with slimy , used cars tactics like Who is the lucky one . I was in the car business at one time when I was young . I was very turned off and surprised they were using these snake oil tactics at a MercedesBenz dealership ! I 've never even seen them do that at , at other luxury dealerships in Southwest Florida ! The Bonita Springs dealership was much more professional ! In all fairness the female salesperson was very professional , and a nice person . The desk manager Had obviously came from this slimy environment ! Go to a Hyundai dealership and your treatment will be the same ! When you 're spending 50 , 000 on a car , you wonder why they would hire people like this ? They even pulled out the foursquare . I just let them go through the bullshit spiel ! I purchased a car less than three days later from MercedesBenz of Fort Lauderdale , where they were 1000 times more professional ! When I explained to the desk manager that his car was overpriced , he actually had the audacity to tell me it was not the same car ! I guess the MercedesBenz dealerships on the other coast somehow get an inferior car from Germany ? LOL ! ! ! Ironically his car was inferior to the one that I purchased because it was older , and had less of a certified warranty . It also had way less options . Unless you like setting money on fire , I would just test drive the car in Bonita they are not snake oil salesman there make an offer , then shop on the other coast . Make sure you compare car for car ! Meaning clean Carfax with the same or more options ! Again , MercedesBenz are excellent vehicles !	0

This stuff smells good , and lathers up nicely right in the container with a shaving brush and some hot water I just wet the brush and work up the lather right in the container . It 's going to last a while the container has lost hardly any of the soap despite dozens and dozens of uses . Between the soap and the brush , I 'm getting better shaves than ever and I have hair that lays flat in weird patterns , making shaving a painful chore . I find that most shaving soaps / gels dry out quickly when on my face , so I lather up and shave one half , then the other .	1

Whether you suffer from mild pain , or chronic deep pain , this is one unit that is n't worth even the cost of the shipping to get it to you .

I love tide , but caution you against purchasing and having it shipped . The first shipment the bottles were cracked and the liquid soap leaked all over the inside of the box , I called amazon and a replacement was sent . I was initially told that I could discard the mess . but afterwards , I was informed that I had to return the initial box or would be billed for the second shipment as well . I told them to cancel the replacement but it was sent anyway and despite many attempts to resolve , i was billed for the second shipment . This has been the ONLY dissatisfactory service that I have experienced with Amazon .	0

Once I discovered Swiffer Duster it became one of my favorite cleaning products .Why do I like it ? 1 . It picks up dust very well2 . Once you are done dusting , you can just toss it out no need to worry where to shake out the dustlike I have to do with my fancy baby lamb duster3 . I absorbs a lot of dust without moving it around , even when I can see the dust on it , it still does a good job picking up new dust . Sometimes I do n't toss it out after each use , if the job was not big enough . I just hang it as is until the next dusting job . It does not lose its grip on the old dust ! 4 . It is compact . The duster before it is fluffed up before us is flat and the holder is just a handle . To fluff it up you just need to shake it .5 . Sometimes I use it without the handle on my computer screen , computer screen , window sills i .e . items at my hand height anyway .I found that the price on the on the duster fluctuates . There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon , this tool is called Online Price Alert . This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify . If you search on online price alert in Google it will be come up at the top . I find this tool to be very helpful .	1
A courtesy vehicle kept riding my bumper even though there was no one around me and I was in the middle lane , then sped around me to slam on his brakes .

Today , this Wahl trimmer was put to rest . I had to throw it away , as it was no longer hygienic for personal use . I kept it very clean , and well oiled .

I 'm extremely happy with the value received from this trimmer I used it almost every day .I never used the attachments provided , but the unit itself is well worth the money .It lasted about 3 years .	1

my comment is not about the movie . it is about the movie theatre . the air condition did not work . it was cooler outside then in the building . we were in number 6 theatre and there was some kind of soft drink that someone had splattered on the screen that was not cleaned up and looked to be left there for awhile . this facililty is located in new lenox il , and it is a shame to see the amc name and our city represented in this fashion my name is lisa winkle and my adress is 235 roberts rd . new lenox il , 60451 . i can be reached at 708 428 3619 if you need further information . i think whoever is managing your company in new lenox needs to be more attentive to what is going on . in closing i would like to say that my family and i go to the amc show in new lenox at least once a week and would hate to have to travel further away from our home to enjoy movie entertainment . now that this is brought to your attention you can make the changes necessary before you receive any more complaints . lisa	0
I used this last night I got it to the consistency it says in the directions and i used it on my root canal that the filling came out of . I also used it on 2 cavities . I made sure to eat first and then brush and floss and dry my mouth then put it in . I then went to bed and its now 10AM the next day so it has had 14 hours to sit and i ate cereal and its all flaking apart and coming out . if i use slight pressure i can actually rub it off . it is set and white and it is hard but even running my tongue over it it goes numb and it flakes pieces off . It must be me though because everyone else says it works but ill be finding another brand	0
A dreadful experience . Went in two years ago to lease a vehicle and swore I 'd never be back . Went again recently thought I 'd try them again shame on me to turn in a leased vehicle and lease another and felt like I 'd been mugged . A first grader could have seen how bad the deal was . As I was leaving the sales manager approached me in an aggressive manner and I felt he was trying to intimidate me to stay . When in my car about to drive off he ran up waving piece of paper and made what I felt was a disparaging remark . Never , never again .	0
The description did n't match what was sent . Needs to state if the product contains Latex . Product contains LATEX and caused immediate problems for the end user . It would be a fantastic product if it did n't contain latex .	0
Our salesman Darren went out his way to answer as many questions as we could throw at him . He was patient and we never felt pressured . We are very happy with the whole experience , one of the most pleasant car buying experiences to date .	1

I tried the Northern 2ply first ? It broke up after awhile in the bowl wo n't clog septic , but was too rough / weak .I exchanged for Northern 3ply Ultra Plush , at WalMart ? It 's stronger / soft .Said it was septic safe on the package , so I used it in my RV during a 300 mile tripWhen I went to empty my black water , all the used tissue was 34Intact34 / clogged the tank ! OMG ! Had to backflush it with a hose , and got sprayed with YUCK ! oI exchanged it for Consumer Reports recommended White Cloud Ultra 3ply ? It 's soft , and gradually breaks up in the bowl after blowing nose .I do n't feel this will clog my septic , but wo n't chance it in my RV .I bought special TP for RV 's , and no more problems !	0

I am about 5'4 , 110115 lbs . I did n't know if I would be a 6 or an 8 and if I wanted the teal or navy . So I bought one of each size in either color . First off , the teal has more green in it , making it more of a turquoise than blue teal shown in the picture the flat blue / green it actually is is not a color I am fond of , especially since there is so much of it on the backside without any cute pattern or design .Both fit pretty well . The 6 was a little tighter , which is good for swimming , but just wearing it , felt like it was pulling my shoulders down and making my back hunch over . Also , the material kept sliding up my backside . The 8 was a little looser and the strap slid if I moved my shoulders , but it was n't making me a hunch back . So it was a tough decision .Also , a major deciding factor was the technicality of the physical composition . Both were labeled as endurance plus , but only the size 8 had it written on the hip . The lining of size 8 was different , the removable cups of the 8 were not as thick which made for an awkward compression on the boobs where the ruching seams are , and the entire hydro bra in general was completely different between the 2 sizes . Now , I do n't know if this was a difference in the size , color , or simply the time each was made . I 'm wondering if one was made before the other and between that time , they changed the pattern slightly .So I do n't know if this is helpful , but I think it can explain why some people like this product , and others do n't . I personally love it . It is well made , great coverage , but I do n't feel like I 'm wearing a granny suit . I love the pattern . Kinda wish the backside was a bit more exciting , but whatever . It is really comfortable and looks great on . I highly recommend it if you are willing to spend the money . It 's quality and will last a long time .	1
Bought both the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo blades here within the last six months and was sorely disappointed . I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor , thought I 'd never use another razor . Then I needed some more and purchased here and was extremely disappointed . The blades were dull , some of the blue strips were already partially white , and I found that with both packs I bought . All the carts I used nicked and scraped and caused irritation . They cost too damned much to accept that . I do n't know if these were counterfeit , used / recycled / resold , or just decreased quality from the factory and really I do n't care Never Gillette Again . I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision . The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time . After shaving with Gillette for 44 years I 'm a permanent Schick customer now . Gillette has forgotten it 's customer and arrogantly thinks it can charge what it wants and sell crap to prove it . Bye Gillette , hello Schick !	0

I , like a lot of people have had many mobile phones thus I have had many cases / protectors / holders etc .I was pleasantly surprised when I got this protective cover . The cover fits perfectly on my Motorola Photon , feels like it would give the same protection a rubbery styled protector would except it does n't grip like a rubber styled holder would . In other words , I can put it in my pocket and when I pull it out , my pocket does n't turn insideout .Another benefit I 've found is that it works with my Technocel clip . I know that seems counter intuitive since I just mentioned I could pull it out of my pocket easily but I ordered them both at the same time and received the Technocel clip later . After getting used to the TPU case , the case that came with the clip would n't do . So I put the TPU case on and it fits in the clip . Perfect . I love them both .	1
with New Balance ? Maybe it 's just my feet . I used to be able to wear New Balance . No more . I 've tried about 10 different NB shoes in the past 3 months and not one of them fit .

Anyone who says these earbuds sound bad must be a real music snob , because I think they sound way better than any stock earbuds I 've ever had .

I have bought two slivers in the last 30 days . First one just simply stopped working and now the second one is auto dialing off my phone log for no reason , I will being listen to music and it will just suddenly start dialing . . BOTH HEAD SETs have problems with play music properly , they both cut in and out all the time . Going back to return and try it one more time . Then on to another brand if it does n't work out . To bad really it is very comy and the niose reduction is excellent ! Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out .	0
I just love Tom 's of Maine products because they contain allnatural ingredients . I have used their deodorants for years , and have gotten good results .This Naturally Dry product lasted for just one application . When I tried to wash up the next morning , it had the consistency of resin or styptic pencil . It could not be washed off , and got all over my washcloth and hands . As a result , practically my entire body was covered with a resinous residue that made it difficult to wash up . It even got into my hair from my hands .Although I paid over 4 for it , I threw it away the next day . I will go back to Tom 's old regular deodorant and be glad it is still available .	0

Ugh ! I had such high hopes for this bra after reading the other reviews . My weight goes up and down and right now I 'm at a rather BIG size bra at 38DD . I was happy to see a Bali bra in a 38DDD and because of the good brand name I have other Bali 's I love and positive reviews I went for it . Just got the bra and wo n't even wear it to work ! Not to be too graphic , but it pulls by boobs out to either side . Very unflattering . I already have bigger breasts , and there is no need to have a bra that now pulls them into my armpit ! Might be alright for smaller breasts , but if your bigger , please save your money and buy something else .	0

I took a chance in spite of several scathing reviews and immediately found out why they hated this product . . . .it does n't work . I placed a few drops of orange essential oil on the pad and inserted it into the lighter socket and almost immediately my truck filled with orange scent . . . .so much so I thought the 5 drops or so I used was too much . But approximately a half hour later it was gone . Tried a new pad drenched in oil . . .same result . It 's not rocket science , so I know I 've done nothing wrong . . .it just does n't work . Save your money .	0
These socks were so cute I was impressed . Even though the sizing was labeled 09 months , I 'm pretty sure they will last for up to a year They also stay up on the little legs and do n't slide down like some others I have purchased in the past . Very nice product .	1

I am smiling as I write this review . If ever there were a case for American manufacturing , this product embodies it . I was impressed when I received an airmail envelope from Hong Kong . I do n't get one of those everyday . When I opened the package it contained 5 screen protectors and a cloth . No instructions . Thee were tabs on both sides of the protector that with a magnifying glass I could make out which was the front and which was the back . This should n't be too hard . It 's not my first time to the rodeo when it comes to screen protectors . I carefully removed the back cover and placed the protector on the phone . It fit like a glove an over sized glove . The protector hung out over all four edges . Not a problem I have an exacto knife . Then I noticed that the cutout for the IR port and the other two sensors was on the wrong side . The screen protector had the adhesive placed on the wrong side . When I turned it over it fit well except for the overhang . It would have worked , but the adhesive prevented my finger from sliding across the screen . It did , however , make the phone very easy to grip . China may have a lot of money , but what they need is W . Edwards Deming . UPDATE I did find the directions for installation in the envelope . Static electricity had glued it to the inside of the envelope . The directions confirmed the process I used .	0

Update I have bought this thing 3 different times because each time I try it , it stops working after about a month . There is an issue with the battery compartment . There are better options available for 30 because you will just end up having to toss it because it will break after a month . THREE times this has happened w / this product . I 'm over it .This is great for personal grooming . It is the best trimmer I have ever used . It is very small which makes it easier to shave and prevent cuts .However , the quality is TERRIBLE . Low grade plastic and a lot of times it wo n't turn on and I have to open it up and mess with the battery . I have bought this once and it had to be replaced . Now I 'm buying it again and it 's after the return time . That should show you that I like the results enough to keep buying it .It really is junk as far as quality goes . I wish that they would just make a quality product and I would happily pay the extra money .	0

I saw so many good things about this diffuser posted on Amazon , and I also saw my share of bad ones . I decided to take a chance because of the colorchanging effect and the fact that it 's a diffuser as well . Bad idea . Maybe I just got one from a bad batch , but this product did n't work right out of the box . I plugged it in over and over and adjusted the plug in , but nothing worked . I tried different levels of water in the diffuser but still nothing . Nothing worked on it whatsoever , and I was severely disappointed . I 'm not discouraging anyone from buying this but BEWARE because it might not work .	0

Buyer beware . They ran my credit through , gave me a deal on the price , then called me after the deal was closed and said that my mint condition car had a terrible leak and they were junking it . YEAH RIGHT ! ! ! I called them back , this spanish girl would not answer my calls at all , she sent me straight to a sales person voice mail 7 times in a row . Then I blocked my number so they could n't see it on caller I d and she answered . And I knew right then and there they were lying about it . They dropped the price so low for me that they must have found someone who would give them more for it and came up with this elaborate story to tell me . Wow . I have reported them to capital one as well . Can not be trusted and playing kiddie games I would not have expected . I went all the way through to the registering the car and they backed out .

The worse BMW dealership in southern California . The self proclaimed leftover manager has no clue what customer relation and respect is . You make an appointment to buy a high end car , he is so unprofessional that constantly puts you on hold , then during the appointment , he is on the phone , going through notes on his desk , and staff barge in none stop . In few minutes you find out he is on line attending a live auction . Totally oblivuous , unprofessional to the core values of the basic conduct . A street smart one who could care less as to why your are there , abd even when you give the hint that I thought we had an appointment goes right over his mind . So I stood up and told him may some other time . Waked out and bought a brand new car from another dealer .	0

I 've just completed my 4th bottle and ca n't say I 've lost a single pound due to this supplement . I 've lost a few pounds but I had already been losing weight prior to starting this due to diet and exercise . This supplement might not be of any benefit to those already on a diet and exercising . I did n't require much weight loss and thought this would push me over the edge from 4 pack abs to a 6 pack abs .I suffered through the following symptoms while taking this supplement . If you dig hard enough online you 'll see a small number of other people have suffered the same or similar side effects . Despite the side effects I decided to tough it out because I was certain it would eventually have a big payoff .At the high end of recommended dosages that you can find about 9 capsules per day I experienced the following symptoms upon waking the morning after starting . Debilitating head ache . Pain medicine barely took the edge off of this headache . Severe lower back pain . It did n't feel like it was in the spine . It felt like it was in the connective tissue touching the spine on the left side of my body . It was tough to stand . Total knee power loss . Sometimes when I 'd take a step I 'd lose all power in my left knee . It would come on suddenly while walking and felt as if a switch that had powered my knee had been turned off . I would nearly fall down before regaining my ability to use my leg .These symptoms especially the headache would n't go away until I dropped dose down to the 3 capsules per day recommended on the bottle and now only have 1 symptom Knee Pain . It 's the same knee that I had the power loss in .I give up on this supplement and am going to go hard core dieting to get the last 1 / 3 inch of stubborn fat off my waist . Waistline fat is the hardest to get rid of and it look like there 's no shortcut for me .UPDATE 9 / 13 / 2013Thinking of all the doctor recommendations I thought I 'd try a different manufacturer . I tried MRM CLA 1250 . The residual knee pain quickly went away and I 'm taking triple the dose . I 'll leave an MRM CLA 1250 review in a few months after I figure out whether it works .	0

I made the deal on a Monday , understanding the car would be available on Tuesday . Unfortunately the car that was to be delivered had issues . Rather than hold the deal up , White Allen replaced the car with the same model colors , trim , options with an identical car that had an additional option and the purchase price remained unchanged . I would challenge any other car dealer to do the same .	1

What service department would let a customer leave without telling them the car is a safety concern and should n't be driven . We got a mile down the road and car died . There was no serpentine belt so it drained battery . Once we had it towed home I read the paperwork they gave me that they did n't take the time to go over with me clearly says we did NOT test drive do to safety concerns and car should n't be on the roads . But when we called back the guy said they test drove it and the power steering and it ran just fine . After arguing with the service department the next day the owner actually called us and apologized we appreciate that but we still have a car that do n't run .	0

This is nearly a great headset . It 's small , the signal and sound are good , and the boomswitch is great . But the fit is extremely finicky , and when you find which one of the earloops work for you , since they do n't stay on the headset well , you will promptly lose it .And then Motorola Support 's voice system will not hear you , you ca n't reach a live person after even 10 minutes on hold , and their phones appear to shut down entirely at 5 pm .Avoid it . Other headsets hold onto the ear loop better or at least let you get replacements .	0
Update 7 / 25 / 2017 see below . BEWARE ! Everything was decent until they permformed thousands of dollars in unauthorized repairs . Then , they had the nerve to lie and say that they did notify us , only they could n't point to a phone call , letter , or email to prove their claim . The way they lied is almost as upsetting as the added costs of unauthorized repairs ! Update My name Greg T . , I spoke to Bob on the phone as requested in his response . He stated that had he been contacted up front this situation could have been avoided . I informed him that we voiced our concerns in person when we picked up the car , sent emails , and notified the BBB who Mini of Loveland LIED to about getting our permission for the repairs . Bob took my info , said he 'd look into what he could do and he would get back with me . That was about a month ago and this whole thing started in January .

I 'm sorry if this review grosses anyone out .I love this kit ! I am a sucker for science and medicine , so I think this kit is so fun to use , not to mention that it helps me breathe when I am going through another allergy season and the pollen is high . That stuff really makes your sinuses swollen and your nose congested . My mom bought me the huge 2bottle pack with 250 packets of premixed saline solution . I use one packet per nostril mixed in with warm tap water , although the directions say to use preboiled or distilled water I do n't have the patience for that ! . The tap water does n't bother my nose , so I continue to use it .Since allergy season started again , I 've been using the saline rinse religiously at least twice a day if not more . I love using it because it is so interesting to me how much crap comes out of my nose . I just used it a few minutes ago and WOW ! There was 3 tissues worth of mucus snot and I was finally able to breathe ! It is amazing and gross how much mucus the human body can produce . Mine seems to be in hyperdrive since it is trying to get rid of the pollen flying up my nose . I can not wait to use it again to see how much comes out this next time ! Even when I do n't have allergies , I like to use it to ward off any sinus issues since I used to get chronic sinus infections . Saline rinse is like good hygiene . Once you use it , you 'll never want to stop when you find out how much better it makes you feel !	1

For over the past three years , I have been servicing my Mini Cooper vehicle at the BMW dealership in Sterling , Virginia . However , over the course of the past year , they have conducted themselves in an unethical and unprofessional manner that has caused me stress and anxiety and the ultimate demise of my Mini Cooper . In September 2014 , I brought my car in for electrical repairs because my car radio would turn on while the car was off . The repairs cost around 3 , 000 . However , starting in December 2014 , the car would only turn on if the car was placed in neutral and I had to return the car to the dealership on December 26 . That charged cost me about 300 . In early December 2015 , I bought my car in for its yearly safety inspection . Their service department advised me I needed a new tire guide for a bent axle on my back tires . In addition , to regular maintenance , the charges cost me , 3063 . 84 . In addition , their service department messed up and ordered the wrong part and had my car in the shop for over three weeks and I needed my car for my job . I did not get it back until 5 days before I had to travel down south . About a month later , my car engine would not fire correctly and the check engine light started to blink rapidly . Upon emergency maintenance , that charged cost me 535 . 29 . Throughout 2016 , my check engine light would go on and off . Although , I only put 10 , 000 miles on my car that year . I slowly began to believe this was an attempt by Mini Cooper Sterling to keep finding more problems . On December 8 , my car was brought into BMW Sterling for its yearly safety and emissions inspection . Upon initial inspection , my service provider told me the car needed an oxygen sensor changed and some electrical and wiring work repaired for dead lights . The cost would be around 2750 . I was told on Saturday December 10 , the Mini Cooper would be completed by early next week . On Tuesday , I was advised the check engine light would not go off because my car needed to be driven around 50 miles to get the emissions to reset and the check engine light to go out . I said no problem and my service provider told me my car would be ready by noon on Wednesday December 14 . At 1130 a . m . , BMW Sterling called me and told me my car would not be ready because they had to run more tests . This is when I started to get nervous again because they have done this in the past . Finally , at 5 pm , my service provider called me and told me I needed a new engine . The total cost for everything would be over 9 , 000 . At this point , I was completely upset and told them I would call Thursday to ultimately decide my option . On Thursday December 16 , I declined any more repairs . I was advised by my service provider my car would be ready by 4 pm . At 350pm , I got to the dealership and waited almost an hour to get my car and was advised that the car was being washed . Granted , it was 25 degrees out and very windy . My service provider did nt even have the courtesy or professionalism to apologize for stealing over 2000 from me . All I got in return was a minor discount for being a part of their dealership club . I paid for this because I need my car for work and the service department made me wait until 5 pm to get my car back after Jack said it would be ready by 4 pm . If I knew from the beginning on December 9 I needed a new engine , I never would have authorized any pointless repairs resulting in the 2 , 291 charge . Because of them , I sold my Mini Cooper at CarMax Gaithersburg for another car . For the past two years , I have given BMW / MiniCooper of Sterling over 10 , 000 to maintain my car and they basically destroyed it and played and manipulated me . In the process , they lost my loyalty and caused stress and anxiety . Please do not take your car into this dealership , they are the perfect reason why places like these get a horrible , despicable name . You lost a loyal customer who trusted you and you completely wrecked and ruined that relationship we had . I will never buy a Mini Cooper again .	0
I wonder if they are just enthusiastic or if this stuff smells worse without the perfume .Other than being extremely smelly it does not seem to have had any effect on the machine one way or the other .I am sure it must be doing something other than smelling . However it is time to move one to some other brand or back to vinegar .Be sure to read the box . The purpose of the cleaner is to help remove odor causing residues in any washer Not for use with clothes I tried to find something positive to say . Oh well .	0

Worst experience ever ! When I decided to buy a new car for the second time from this dealer we had a balance due of 600 . The dealer told us to not worry about this balance , he will take care of it . Since then I received a letter from a collection company and I lost 80 points on my credit score . I met the finance director , he said he will fix this problem . Nothing changed since one month and he does n't answer the phone or his email . There are such good dealer everywhere , do n't take any risk with this one .	0

Very disappointedAfter multiple complains from soldiers in Fort Polk AL I went and give this dealership and chance to work on my BMW X6 , because thought they were all wrong . I took my car for a service due to a recall problem , while searching I did nt had any other position beside this Walkers BMW . After 2 days of keeping my car in their shop , they told me that they do not have parts to fix my car , but they are going to fix another part which is under warranty , so I do nt have to pay anything . But when I went to pick up my car their service people told me the bill for this work is 370 . 00 dollars , they called Labor work , but it was under warranty . While they kept car for fix the recall problem they made me get a rental car for 100 . 00 . So , without fixing the recall part on my car I had to pay close to 500 . 00 dollars . I was very disappointed with my overall experience from this business . I would strongly advise everyone to avoid doing any business with this place . Just a horrible experience	0
BUYERS BEWARE ! ! ! ! ! I bought my Certified PreOwned 2013 X3 in 2015 from Motorwerks BMW in Bloomington . I was assured that my car was in good as new condition , hence the CERTIFIED status . My car looked beautiful and I could not have been happier . Fast forward to one year later . I noticed some rust and some paint buckling on the front passenger door and I thought it is just some paint succumbing to the salt and sand on Minnesota roads , and the BMW will take care of me . I took my car in to have the Motorwerks BMW look at it and take care of the issues just as they have been so far . After waiting for nearly 1 . 5 hours I get to talk to a Service Manager who claims that since the car had had some paint work done somewhere else , they will not fix the rust . Wait ! What ? My car had been painted somewhere ? I was not told any of that when I bought my car . The excuse I got was that they did not know that my car had been painted when they got the car from the previous owner and therefore they will not fix the rust . Again , no paintwork was disclosed to me at the time of the sale and thus I was under the impression that my car had been thoroughly inspected and that if was in almost new condition with all the ORIGINAL BMW parts . That impression included the paint . Again , I bought it under BMW CERTIFIED program . To make the entire situation even more absurd , the Service Manager had a guy from a body shop just down the road come and talk to me and he gladly disclaimed the they fix the scratches and dings all the time and they do not report any of these repairs to CarFax . He seemed to be proud of all of these paint jobs that they do for Motorwerks BMW daily , that these paint jobs do not get reported and often do not get disclosed to the buyers either . When I asked how many of these cars with unreported and undisclosed paintjobs are driving on Minnesota roads he proudly disclaimed Hundreds . So , any of the customers that have purchased their vehicles at Bloomington BMW Motorwerks may run into the very same issue thus BUYERS BEWARE ! ! ! ! I contacted the General Manager and their Customer Satisfaction Manager Ursula several times and every time I was promised a call back , which of come . When my next service became due and I needed new tires I went to BMW in Minnetonka . Their service department had their auto body specialist look at the rusty door and concluded that the body work that had been done could not have been missed during the certification process as it was just this bad . Long story short , I feel very much taken advantage by BMW Motorwerks in Bloomington as they clearly sold me a car that had body work done and they knew it . The car supposedly had warranty under Certified PreOwned and on top of that they also sold me an additional Appearance Warranty that was supposed to cover any paint issues . BMW Motorwerks in Bloomington does not stand by the product they sell and their lack of integrity in doing business . They have made no attempt to work with me in correcting their mistake . My warning to anyone thinking about buying a BMW do so with caution if you consider one at Motorwerks in Bloomington . You may end up with more problems that you bargained for and do not expect BMW Motorwerks to even try to make it right .	0

I purchased this because I take my phone with me everywhere . Well I tested the case for 24 hours in the sink and it held up so I thought I 'd give it a go ! Well I put my phone in the pouch sealed it up and way I went . About 3 hours later I went to take my phone out only to realize my phone screen protector had adhered itself to the inside of the plastic of the pouch ! Not only did it ruin my screen protector by ripping it off , more like gluing itself to the plastic , it ruined the inside of the pouch ! Now my zagg shield is not covered by their warranty so now I am stuck with a useless pouch that has screen protector stuck to it and an unprotected phone that now I have to buy another protector for ! Stay away if you use not so cheap screen protectors on your device	0
i 'm very disappointed with the lack of customer service with the fandango site . i purchased my movie tickets with this site and when the system glitched i found my tickets were from another state . after being told that i could change my tickets at the movie theater in my state . sooo not true sent back to fandango customer service after waiting for long period of time on hold was told because the movie time had already past so they would not refund me my money even when they were told about the different state mistake ( because of their system ) . i will never use this site again and will be sure to let others know that these kinds of problems are not their problem .	0

never again at the amc theaters in danbury , ct . we used fandango for les miserables on 12 25 . when we arrived , the line for ticket purchases was very long and so was the line at the one kiosk that worked of four that are there . i waited longer to obtain my fandango tickets than i would have stood in line , and that defeats the purpose , not to mention that it affected our finding well placed seats . amc in danbury ct had out of order on one kiosk but three were broken . what good does fandango do in this case ? no good .	0
a friend of mine purchased 5 tickets on thursday 7 2 for the inside out movie to play on 7 3 at the cinemark 16 theatre in somerdale , nj . my 5 year old niece wanted to come with us so i purchased a ticket on fandango the day of the movie ( instead of getting to the movie theatre and it be sold out ) and chose the somerdale movie theatre on my cell phone , when the confirmation came it was the wrong movie theatre . i called to see if i can get a refund or exchange for the correct movie theatre and was told no because it was n't 2 hours before the movie was supposed to start . i then had to purchase a ticket for the correct movie theatre because the woman i spoke to could not help me nor would the manager . for a 8 . 50 ticket and 1 . 00 fee to purchase online is a little ridiculous that i could not be refunded . i guess fandango does n't give people the option to invite another person to the movies the same day . i feel this is a disgrace especially when i am getting charged extra to buy a ticket online .	0

More and more people are using their iPhone / iPod Touch camera to take photographs and video . While the camera quality is decent on these products , it can be awkward to try to take pictures as these devices do not have the feel of a camera due to their thin , sleek design .Belkin 's LiveAction Camera Grip does the trick here . If you use your iPhone / iPod for more than an occasional photo , you may appreciate this product . It gives you an easy to use , lightweight solution to help you hold your iPhone / iPod more like a conventional digital camera or camcorder .The Camera Grip attaches easily and securely . It is advertised as an accessory for the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch . I 've used it with these , and also tried it on my 3 G devices , which it fits on equally as well .To put the grip on , you simply connect it to the device 's charger port . The grip has an adjustable arm so it can adapt to various cases . I have tried it on a couple of hard shell cases as well as my favorite Speck PixelSkin . Once connected , the grip gives you a nice grip on the right side of your camera , along with a good size ' shutter button .'If you are taking several photos or video , it is nice to be able to hold the Apple device as a camera as opposed to holding it so that your fingers might get in the way or it can slip from your grasp .The grip also has a tripod mount on it , making it convenient if you want to tripodmount your device . I have read where some people complain about the location of the mount , but to me it is no different than on an actual camera , where the tripod mount is on the bottom of the camera , and you depend on your tripod 's flexibility to put the camera in different orientation portrait / landscape / somewhere in between .The one caveat about the product is it functions only with Belkin 's LiveAction camera / video application free at the App Store . The app , while not groundbreaking , works well . It is no better than Apple 's native Camera app , and in some ways not as flexible , but in the end it works as advertised . Note LiveAction does use its own camera roll so any images you capture with the app are stored there , not in the default Camera Roll .Other than that it is pretty straight forward with the typical nuances of an accessory for Apple products When its attached , the port is occupied so you can not charge or connect the device . Depending on your case design , physical buttons may / may not be inaccessible .Overall , the product and by the way , the LiveAction app work very well . If your intended use is once in a great while for your own amusement , the price is probably too high . On the other hand , if you use your iPhone / iPod as a camera / camcorder more than on rare occasions , this is a nice addition to your Apple accessories the added safety of having a firm grasp of your Apple device is alone worth the cost .	1

The main appeal for the Zagg products is its ' guarantee ' but realize with this guarantee you 've to pay 4 for shipping and handling of a tiny plastic sleeve and you must ship back your original product which is aobut another 1 when you figure postage and envelope .So in other words you spent 5 on shipping fees for a 10 product . Does n't sound like Zagg has much confidence in their product after allif they did they would pay for the bogus shipping fees instead of leaving you on the hook for them .Nonetheless , I got the product at Best Buy , since apparently Best Buy cut a deal with Zagg and will only offer Zagg products , and then Best Buy whacks you another 8 to put the product on . So by the time you 're said and done it 's about 30 for a tiny plastic screen protectora total ripoff ! To add insult to injury in a few weeks my screen protector cracked and warped . After doing all the steps for the bogus warranty , I will never buy one of their shoddy , ripoff products again !	0

Let me be clear i 'm a 2 m guy , having no problems to wear american XL sizes . Own a Champion 1780 XL Sweat Ash and 3 other colors XL 's too , i like and use Ash so much that i ordered one more , at under moments . To order only one more was the only luck at this purchase .

I dislike the 34hand sanitizer smell34 that most sanitizers have and was pleased to find the liquid GermX has a fairly manageable smell quite unlike typical hand sanitizer . I 've used it in my classroom all year ! So when I decided to keep wipes in my car , I checked the box stores and did n't find individual GermX though I did smell the container of wipes and it kept the nice GermX smell , so I ordered these online only to find they do n't smell like GermX and they DO have the gross hand sanitizer smell . They were more expensive than the other brands that I would like just as well . I will not reorder .	0

Purchased the car on Aug 18 , 2017 for 38 K out the door4 . Drove the car for a few days and went out of town for 10 days5 . Came back and drove the car for a day and by Sept 2 2017 the engine blow6 . When i went back to Benz they said they ca n't do anything about it and luckily the car still has warranty ? Really ? ! 7 . They were n't willing to help me out at all and told me to tow it to Dodge and have them look at it8 . Sure enough they did and the car needs a new engine . 9 . spoke to the mechanic and he said it had to be a preexisting problem . So much for Certified pre owned . Worse dealership ever . Wish i could give them . 5 star .	0

This case is so soft and plushy , and at first that bothered me . But after putting it on my phone I realized that it is protected just fine and it is very snug .	1
These shoes were so wide that even when I ordered a full size below what I normally wear they were so wide that each step I took when trying them on resulted in them falling off my feet . They also smelled of harsh plastic . They seemed like they would be comfortable if they had fit . They also looked very cheaply made . Returned .	0

Some quick thoughts on this model specifically Removes smaller hairs than other models , so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back The massagers on the epilation head really do help You can use it dry or completelywet , but not damp e .g . , right after the shower wo n't work . . . and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort , although it 's a bit harder to notice stray hairs You ca n't use it while plugged in that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower ! but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge , you 'll have to toss the unit This includes a trimming head , for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack they have to be 1 cm or shorter before this will really pull them out This also includes a specialized cap for moretargeted facial hair basically it just covers most of the epilator so you can do just a 1 / 4 strip at a time , which reduces pain notably , but remember to use caution and do this only with a clean epilator , or it can make you break out The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed The wipes really do help . You 'll use one and think it did n't help that much , then try the other leg without one at all , and realize it WAS helping more than you realized I used them the first time I epilated , but have n't bothered subsequently . I have n't tested to see whether using the wipes or epilating underwater is better overall , and I do n't know if you could do both , or if the water would rinse off the helpful ingredient from the wipes . Could be worth a test . . .And some thoughts on epilation in general This seems obvious , but I have to say it it only hurts when a hair is being removed . This means that the first time you epilate , it 's very uncomfortable . But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again assuming you do it at least once every 3 months ! , the subsequent touchups really are n't bad at all , especially on your legs . Underarms are less comfortable , and bikini area even less so . Face is also quite sensitive , though that probably varies by person , depending on how much tweezing you normally do . The first time you epilate , your legs will be unbelievably smooth . But hair grows back at different rates , so after a month or so of epilating maybe one time each week , you 'll have tiny hairs here and there , that are starting to grow back , but are still too small to get . It 's less of an issue with this epilator than others , and the hairs are n't really visible . So if you think someone 's going to be touching your legs , then shave D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so . Then if you do n't bother doing anything for a month or so , you 'll have a few stray hairs here and there , but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month or even a week . . . or even 3 days . Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past . You do have to use a loofah or some other type of exfoliation on your legs occasionally to prevent ingrown hairs just little bumps on your legsmine do n't turn red . But if you wax , or if you age you 'll have to do that anyway And how could I forget the 1 reason to epilate no more underarm bumps . You know , the ones that you ALWAYS have , despite a million products on the market that say they 'll banish them but do n't ? Sometimes when you epilate , your skin will be red for 3090 seconds afterward , but then it fades . So NO MORE BUMPS . That alone is reason enough to own an epilator , IMO This also helps with bikiniarea bumps , but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade , so it 's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time	1

I gave this product one star because I did n't even have the chance to really test it 's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on . I followed all the directions , washed and dried the affected area , etc , etc . My blister was on my hand , while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running .The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine . Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off .The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on . Do n't get me started on the cost of these either . Regardless of which option you chose , your paying at least 80 cents per cushion . That 's a rip off . You could purchase 40 band aids for that price , use some neosporin and replace them each day . Much cheaper .Would not recommend .	0

I had previously owned a Panasonic ES8243A . It shaved almost as close as a blade with no irritation , way superior to my old Norelco . But my suitcase was stolen shaver included and I opted for Panasonic 's latest top of the line 5 blade model . No need for the more expensive ESLV81 K with the cleaning unit since liquid soap and water worked just fine with my previous Panasonic . While my previous model shaved very close , this is the first electric shaver I 've used that shaves as close as a safety razor with identical results after skipping a day , and no irritation ! And I 'm talking about both neck and face no stubble ! This is a detailed description of how I get such close results Before going to bed , I wash my face and neck with a couple drops of USkincare Awaken Foam Cleanser and USkincare Bamboo Polish which is an exfoliating scrub . I just use the Bamboo Polish twice a week to avoid irritating my skin . Next , I apply a couple pumps of USkincare Moisture Control Lotion with Vitamin C .In the morning , I take a shower to moisten and hydrate my face . I do n't wash my face because the natural oils help to lubricate the skin . Then I heat some water to 180 F while my shaving brush is soaking in hot water in the sink . When my electric kettle beeps , I pour the water into my Dirty Bird Pottery shaving scuttle original style . I spend about a minute to create a good lather with Classic Shaving Cream unscented and a Rooney best quality badger brush . Then I spend another minute to thoroughly lather my face . Next I shave , detach the foil head , lightly rinse out the cutters , and lather my face again . When I shave my face a second time , I shave my neck , cheeks , and chin 90 from the first shave . Shaving just once does not give me a safety razor close shave . Then I remove the foil head and briefly rinse the cutters and foil , reattach the foil head , squirt on a couple pumps of diluted Dr . Bronners liquid soap on the foil , run the shaver at the automatic 20 second highspeed cleaning mode while rinsing my face with warm water , remove the foil head , rinse the blades at the automatic 20 second highspeed cleaning mode , rinse the foil head , and let airdry .Next , I rinse my face with cold water to close the pores and towel dry . Then I spray USkincare Damask Rose Hydrosol Regenerating Toner on my face and neck , tap my face with my fingertips to spread the toner , and let it dry for a couple minutes . Next I use a couple pumps of USkincare OilFree Aloe Hydrant Gel with Green Tea and spread it across my face and neck . A good moisturizer is an important step to keep the skin moisturized .These products are relatively expensive when compared to drug store brands , but they last quite a while because I have to use only a small amount each time . Plus they 're hypoallergenic , the shave is very close , and my face does n't feel any irritated afterwards . I 'm not into using shaving cream that 's a petroleum derivative or other potentially harmful nonorganic products on my skin . I never thought different skin care products made such a big a difference before using USkincare .Now let 's get to a review of the shaver itself . I 've only been using it for three months but am not concerned about the longevity since my previous Panasonic performed flawlessly for a couple years . My beard is on the thick side but my skin is sensitive . When I first began using the shaver , I was a little disappointed because my skin was slightly red for the first few days . But my skin seemed to adjust and after the first week and there was no more redness . Panasonic promotes this shaver as requiring less passes than my old model but I find little difference in the amount of passes required . The main difference is in the closeness of the shave and zero irritation . I 've never used this shaver dry . I 've used my previous Panasonic wet / dry shaver dry a few times and preferred it wet . Since I have a shaver that takes advantage of the benefits of wet shaving , it makes no sense to not use a high quality shaving cream . The LED light on this newer model is brighter , so I can see it clearly even in a brightly lit room . At first , the foil head seemed huge but with the pivoting feature , it feels great on my face . The shaver felt almost too light when I started using it but now I appreciate how little it weighs . Ergonomics are perfect . I do n't find myself accidentally pushing the power switch and the power lock is a clever feature for travel . And the noise level is quite low . I do n't use the trimmer feature so I ca n't comment on it . The replacement cutter and foil combo sells for around 50 . The cutters and foil head on my stolen Panasonic were almost ready for replacement after two years so I expect the new ones to last just as long . Panasonic recommends replacing the foil head once a year and the cutters once every other year as a general guideline .Conclusion Yes , it 's expensive , but what you 're getting is a very high quality marvel of engineering that will give you the closest , most comfortable electric shave possible . It 's something you will use and appreciate every day or can get away with using every other day . And it will put a smile on your face . Is it worth the money ? Hell yes ! This shaver is flawless .Cons There is no stand for the razor so that it can rest vertically and take up less shelf space . It would also look nicer on a stand . Panasonic should design and offer a stand with a clip or something to hold the foil head while it 's drying after cleaning . And something like a neoprene travel case would be a nice touch rather than an ordinary vinyl case , given this is a premium shaver at a premium price .	1

i 'm not sure why your developer thought it was a good idea to set a delay on showing the words get 'em while we got 'em . guarantee your tickets . after the page loads , but he she should place a container around the div class tsp offer div and set it to the appropriate height so the tags below it do n't shift . i went to select a theater 3 times as the page loads ( 3 separate page loads obviously ) and ended up clicking on the my theaters tab because it moved to where the theater select is . it 's really just annoyance .	0

It is not an exaggeration when I say this is the best experience I 've ever had with a car dealership . I walked in on a Friday simply to confirm to myself that I was making the right decision to lease from Audi , who I had been negotiating with , and by Saturday I was the proud owner of a new BMW . Vehicle quality aside , the service at this dealership is honestly what swayed my decision . Lindsey Harper is a wonderful sales associate , knowledgeable , extremely friendly , and more than willing to indulge an overly analytical customer like myself with as many different vehicle and financial option scenarios as I could come up with . This is my 4th leased car but the first of many BMWs thanks to this dealership .	1

Well , when this arrived it certainly motivated me to learn how to remove my lenses with my hands . Even my opthamologist and his staff had no idea this tool existed for soft lenses . If I was having issues removing my lenses with my hands , then this was simply far worse . NO WAY CAN I STICK A TWEEZERLIKE OBJECT / DEVICE IN / ON THE SURFACE OF MY EYE . I can now remove my lenses myself with no assistance . I am also aware that the staff at the doctor 's office is determined to learn to use this . This tool is very soft / rubbery / flops around a lot . Some videos help but so far they can do only one eye and it takes a really long time . This tool was effective in enabling me to remove my lenses without it . From that perspective it does deserve 5 stars because I hate this thing .	0

Today I Am going to the Swanson Vitamins web sight place an order on some more of this Garlic Oil because Garlic Oil Is a Natural Antibiotic and God willing It will be the last time I buy It , but being surrounded by fluorideheads I do Not know If that Is possible . I have been buying this Garlic Oil for years I can remember when It was like 3 .99 now Its almost 7 .00 and that does Not Include the shipping cost last night I ordered some small Electronic parts and got eat alive by the shipping cost and of course They ship through UPS Not USPS as They used to and It does Not matter If Your shipping something next door UPS will take a week to deliver It . Go to YouTube and see how cheap and easy It Is to make Garlic Oil , boy I wish I could do that but as I said being surrounded by fluorideheads makes everything Impossible and expensive . Use the container to get ride of fleas get a small white LED Bicycle or any type white or green LED light put It In container the green flashing light will attract fleas then put It on a mouse sticky trap or soap dish but the fluorideheads has got Me so messed up I can Not do that Nether .	0

I thought because I have wide feet that Birkenstocks would be an ideal brand for me . I have low arches . These shoes are 34ergonomic34 with built in arch support but they do not conform to where the arch is on my feet so I feel like I am walking on rocks . Maybe I need a bigger size ? The back top of the heel is very high up on the heel , almost like a pull tab . But because the leather is so stiff , this has been rubbing my skin raw . I 'm pretty disappointed because I really wanted these to work but they are too painful .	0

Did absolutely nothing for me . I8217 m a lifelong insomniac . I have tried this quite a few times and noticed absolutely no good effects .

I think this is a great phone . As mentioned , the Danger network is no longer available , therefore some of the features do n't work . But for the low price and the quality of the phone , it 's well worth it . The screen swivels open smoothly . Colors are vibrant . Instructional cd is a great help for some of the trickier features . And TMobile is always eager to help . I was able to copy my sim card address book over easily . So until I qualify for a new phone on my tmobile plan , this phone will do just fine and be fun to use too .My only dissappointment I will mention is the memory card was not included in the packaging . I read that in someone elses review and emailed Amazon before my phone shipped and they confirmed that it would be present . But it was n't . Its mentioned in the advertisement as being part of the package . So be aware of that . Although Amazon has kindly offered to compensate me , I would have just preferred the memory card to be included .Update Amazon has given me a little bigger refund which allowed me to purchase the memory card seperately . Thank you Amazon !	1

I used this product in conjuction with Green coffee bean extract and started to drastically loose my hair . . . .i used the product for a month and did n't even take the last three pills because I value my hair . . . .so caution , depending on your body it could happen to you too . Also , I did not see or feel any type of results in the month of taking the pill once a day in the AM .

I must first explain that I have suffered from insomnia off and on since I had my sons . I think it is a combination of being a parent , stress from work and getting old I have seen recent studies concerning women and insomnia . As a result , I have tried various sleep aids prescription and overthe counter and have even resorted to PM medicines when it is really bad . To me , Ambien and its generic version works well but since it is a prescription you must use it sparingly . Lunesta , which I have also tried , works well but leaves a metallic taste in my mouth that I ca n't stand the next day . I have also found that the Sam 's Club and Target brand sleep aid works just as well as the Nature Made brand , Sominex or Unisom name brands . So while I was n't necessarily expecting the effects of a prescription drug , I did expect my experience to be something similar to what I have when I use the other overthecounter brands that I have tried in the past . Not to mention , I really had high expectations since I saw that this product was offered by the makers of Nyquil which has been known to knock me out when I have a horrible cold and need rest . Unfortunately , the Zzzquil sleep aid did n't work for me . I took the two capsules the recommended dose . . . .and I will note that the size of the gel capsules were good , not too big , and easy to swallow and waited for them to kick in . Unfortunately 3 1 / 2 hours later I was still awake and flipping thru television stations and playing words with friends on my iPad to which no one was responding , but I always have about 10 games going at once . And once I finally dozed off , I woke up an hour and a half later ! Meaning I did n't stay asleep . Unlike some sleep aids that leave you feeling somewhat rested or like you have been asleep for awhile when you do awaken in the middle of the night , I did n't feel that way with this product . I just felt restless . And when I eventually did doze off again , it was n't a really deep sleep . So , I would guess that a plus for using this product is that I did n't have that drowsy feeling the next morning , BUT I also did not feel rested .Positives The gel capsules are easy to swallow . Did n't feel drowsy the next day .Negatives THE BIGGEST . . . .Didn't make me fall asleep . Took a long time to take effect . Did n't keep me asleep . It is pricey compared to some of the alternatives out there . 2 pills per dosage and there are only 12 in the box means 6 doses for a little under 6 . Not too great of a value .Neutral Ca n't tell if it is habit forming because I did n't use this product long enough . And because I did n't get the results that I wanted , I would n't even take the product anymore nor would I have a way of finding out .Overall , I give this product 1 star for the easy to swallow gel capsules .	0

They had this displayed at one of the big chain stores so you can try it . I tried to stick my phone to it not even close ! the phone just wo n't stay on the mount . I 'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it USED to work at some point and maybe just wore out or something but either way I would never get it . go for iOttie . Much better .	0

The salesman disrepect me and very rude . He questioned my visa and my working status , which is all valid . But it makes me feel like I am illegal and poor here . I come here only want to buy a car , not to be humiliated ! Never come to this place again ! The worst salesman met !	0
i have no problem with fandango but if there is anyway you can communicate to theaters to turn the sound down , that would be great . this is an ongoing problem . sometimes people go out and complain . it does n't change . i loved les mis , just had to hold my ears for most of it . previews are even worse . i am not alone in this . many people complain about it in the theater but probably do not say anything to management after the movie . thank you .	0

No exaggeration . . No hatred or intend to defame anyone . This dealership must be more transparent with their car selling . I know it 's about selling at the end of the day and whatever you can say to sell stuff . A valuable transaction is about retaining the current customers and getting more customers through current customers with no extra advertisements . To be precise , this dealership upsells cars with hidden mechanical problems and not transparent about it . So there will be a great surprise when you resell it even if you maintain the car with periodic service . Customers do n't come with automobile knowledge when they purchase and a good dealership should be transparent with the transaction at least about known mechanical issues and should not take advantage of customers . I know this can be legally defensible by the seller . I 'm just talking about valuable trade .	0
UPDATE DOUBLE BLEH ! Below is my original post where at the end I mention I mightgive the 2 bottles I have to my sister . I did . She uses only the powder form so Ithought she be okay with it . She got back to me and agreed it is horrible .Original Post when title was just Bleh ! When I first learned about Stevia , I was advised to not use the powder form as it has a bitter aftertaste and stick with the liquid which has little to none . As I found the right liquid form to use alcohol free , etc . , I 've been quite happy with it , but it 's not very easy to travel with .The rave reviews of this powder form of having no bitter aftertaste made me think that I finally found a powder I could use . So not only did I buy one bottle , I bought 2 of them because all those reviews ca n't be wrong , right ? Now I am wondering if these folks have taste buds or know what bitter aftertaste is . lol . Perhaps they never had the liquid form to know the difference ? I mean we are talking hundreds of people , so how can I be right , right ? I especially do n't want to insult anyone , but I can not figure out why so many people are saying no bitterness when on my first use on food I usually used the liquid form on , I used the powder form and it was horrible . Bitter to the nth degree . Then I thought , maybe I did n't put enough in . So I added a little more . I successfully took the food from tasting horrible to being absolutely inedible , bleh ! So I have an unopened bottle and a practically full bottle and you know , sometimes we all ca n't agree on the same foods , right ? Like my nephew does n't like ice cream . Does n't like ice cream ? ! ? ! I never thought that was possible ! I also suspect that I am partially on the supertaster side of the taste bud spectrum because many of the foods that supertasters can not tolerate , I ca n't either , but not all of the foods on the list so that 's why I say I 'm partially on the supertaster side . So it may be the case that my taste buds are just more sensitive to detecting bitterness .I wish I knew what to do with these two bottles . Maybe my sister and mother would like to try it out . I 've gone back to the liquid form .I hope others do n't jump in with 2 feet like I do . Probability has it that most will like it , but I advise to not be foolish like me and just get 1 bottle thefirst time .	0

A week ago , I was like you . I was browsing around Amazon looking at several car mounts for the Samsung Galaxy Note II . Fortunately , it did n't take me long to find the one product with the most positive reviews of all the choices I found .So , here you are . Obviously , you have already been reading a lot of really positive comments about this car mount . If you have n't already pushed the PURCHASE button you got ta be crazy . I mean , I read about 20 reviews and knew immediately that for the price , this might be the best bang for the buck available for my new phone .Ordered it , it arrived , I immediately installed it in my Cadillac SRX .I'll tell you right now , this mount is AWESOME ! But of course , I 'll give you a few reasons why . . .I do n't want any car mount that deals with sticky glue to keep it attached to the dashboard . When you remove the film from the suction cup you 'll be surprised to find a sticky glue substance . Do n't worry about that . You can stick and remove this mount as many times as you want and it wo n't leave any residue on your vehicle . It also claims I have n't tried it yet but have read many reviews with positive results that by simply running the suction cup under water and allowing it to air dry , you will restore that stickiness to its brandnew state . WOW .But get the sticky stuff out of your head . The real powerhouse to talk about here is the stand 's suction cup vacuum mount . You simply press the mount into place firmly and close the vacuum latch . That mount is n't going anywhere soon .The mount has excellent build quality . Does n't feel cheap . Does n't feel like it 's going to fall apart . For 20 I am amazed I am getting a product of this caliber .But did I talk about the most amazing thing about the iOttie mount ? It really is OneTouch .You take your phone , place it in the slot against the back plastic and the holding arms snap into place . To remove , you simply press the side release button , the holding arms spread apart and you pull out the phone . It 's all done by one hand and you wo n't believe how effortless the process is .Works beautifully with my Seidio Surface Case . Have read it works with thicker cases as well .Really , if you have read this far down and are not convinced this is the mount for you , then you should n't be buying it . Go ahead and spend more money for something inferior . Your loss .	1

Bad service	0
not a bad journey at all	1
I saw a nice used BMW for sale on their website . I contacted their Inernet Sales person and was told the car was in the shop with their mechanics and someone would get back to me as soon as the car was done . That was close to a week ago . I have called and left a voice mail inquiring about the car and no one called back . They sent me emails asking if i had been taken care of and I responded that I had n't and I did n't even receive a reply from my reply . Normally you hear of poor dealership service after you buy but rarely before the sale . It has been a total waste of my time and I can not recommend Kia of White Plains .	0

I ordered both the black and the white and I am happy I did . I plan to wear tube tops under these because I do n't have the middle I did prekidsHAHAand to add a pop of color under them . These tops are nice and flowy and the mesh / lace is super soft . I was expecting it to be itchy honestlyI was going to order these tops a year ago and hesitated because of thatboy I was wrong ! My only recommendation with these is if you have shorter or thicker arms like I do you need to upsize or they will probably be too tight . The elastic does n't have much give in the drop sleevesjust an FYI . I got an L to be safe and I am glad I did . These tops are cool because you can upsize and they wo nt add bulk to your frame . Other than thatyou ca n't go wrong with these topsthey are very versatile and super unique . I ca n't wait to wear these this summer !	1

I bought a set of these along with a few other brands to test just to see which ones were the best . In my opinion , Duracell Quantums are the best AA Alkaline batteries , but surprisingly , these batteries were almost as good , surpassing Alkalines from Energizer , RayOVac , and others .I tested the batteries with a Maha / Powered C9000 charger analyzer discharge mode only . While the analyzer is intended for NiMH batteries , you can discharge primary nonrechargeable batteries with it you just can not recharge them .While my tests may not be 100 scientific , I did discharge the batteries at both a 500mA and 1 , 000mA discharge rate , which mimics a camera load 500mA in standby mode viewing the screen , etc , or 1 , 000mA in active mode taking photos , etc .So my conclusion is for the price , these are very good batteries . The only issue I see is you should buy Alkalines with at least a 5yr remaining shelf life , and unfortunately , you have no control over shelf life when buying batteries online .	1
Nice design , idea and size , but after some weeks not charged . Maybe internal charger is failed , red light flicker continues . .	0
1 . Here 's the bottomline in regards to this producta . Nicely made very solid and fairly compact .b . It 's pretty much a no brainer to use . Plug it in to charge up the unit . When you need to charge up another mobile device just use the proper cables , turn on the unit and start charging the mobile device .c . I ca n't say how long it lasts because I 've never had occasion yet to drain all of it 's power I 've been on a trip to HI with an ipad , galaxy tab 2 , i pod touch , GPS unit .d . Flexibility it 's a huge advantage to have one of these , especially on trips , because there will be times when the power on some device goes out and you may be on the road . . . and be lost . . . and the gps just died plug this little unit in and you 're back in business .2 . Highly recommended .	1

This was one of the most unpleasant service experiences I have ever had . I had my car there three times in the past few weeksfirst to diagnose and be told the part had to be ordered . I was told it would be there in 2 days and they would call me . I called after I never heard from them and was told the part was there . I then got another call telling me the part was there and the advisor I was working with was no longer there . Ok . Took it in to be fixed and immediately heard the same noise before I could even leave the lot . I asked Kevin to get in and he said he heard that when I drove it this morning . Yet , it was n't fixed . He asked me to bring it back , which I did this past Friday . I was told the car would be done around 3 or 4 . I called around 5only to be told my car would n't be ready until Saturday at noon . I do n't have another car and my son needed to be picked up , so I had to walk to go get him from day care . Dewayne did offer a loaner , but I was n't coming back over there and going through the trouble . At this point , I have no faith in World Car . I finally got my car back on Saturday . I wish I had a nice ending to the story , but I do n't because it is STILL NOT FIXED . They did allegedly give me a disount on the 2nd repair , but if I am still hearing the noise , I am not clear on what I just spent 665 . 38 on after the initial 500 . Per their notes , the car is operating as designed . Horrible experience . The only bright spots were Dewayne who interestingly was n't there when I picked it up this last time , Austin I observed him with others and he has great customer service skills and the shuttle driversReuben and Leon .	0
what does the mobile ticket icon even look like ? i usually get my tickets at the credit card unmanned kiosks since it is much quicker than waiting in lines . so , it appears as though none of the theatres around me have mobile ticketing . in this time of technology i ca n't imagine why all of them do n't . this was unknown to me until after i purchased tickets . now i have to wait in line to get tickets i have already purchased . so i ask , what is the purpose of fandango if mobile ticketing is only available at select theatres . i will not be using fandango again until mobile ticketing is available at a majority of the big named theatres . why would i ? i now get to stand in a 30 minute line today to see the hobbit , when it usually takes me less than 5 minutes to order tickets at the unmanned kiosks .	0

I like these headphones . I bought a cheaper model from Sony earlier , but really wanted to experience the best bluetooth headphones Sony makes . So far , I really do n't have any complaints . The sound quality is very nice much better than openear styles , pairs easily with my PC , G1 , PS3 , and my Vtech home phone . Using it for phone calls is average , but very acceptable . Blocks out a lot of noise naturally and can even use them while mowing the grass without cranking the volume all the way up to hear it over the mower . Range varies depending on whether you 're using it to talk on the phone or listening to music I get a good 20 feet for music little or no obstructions and about 30 feet using for phone couple of rooms away for telephone .For me , I 've found the perfect pair of wireless headphones . Make sure to read some of the more detailed reviews here lots of helpful info you 'll want to know before you make the investment . These should easily satisfy 85 of buyers .	1
Do not go there ! ! Will update with details on my whole experience soon . . Wish I had read the reviews carefully , specially the negative ones . This is my 7th car from a dealership , and they get the prize of the most inefficient dealership I have ever dealt with . 10 / 4 / 2017So its been about 6 weeks now . Mr Theo Elbert , replied saying that they will try to resolve any issues they could . Made them aware that I have not received any registration / title paper work and thus no plates . No action taken what so ever . They have taken more than 6 weeks to review the paperwork which was already completed at the time of purchase . In this day n age , this is unacceptable ! ! ! Reflects the kind of dealership being run .	0
The purple plastic on the the case was hard to take apart to get the phone on . The hole in the case did NOT line up . The black rubber on the case fell off all the time from being too loose .

My experience with BMW of Fairfax was less then stellar . Let me explain I get a bill that s over 1400 obvisiously things need to be repaired and maintence so I expected a bill that would be in the high hundreds . A couple services that was utterly ridiculous was the wheel lock removal cost which totaled 350 now I do nt know about you but a wheel lock removal should nt have taken 2hrs of labor . When you claim that your mechanics and technicians are certified and the best of the best . On top of this when I mentioned that the service was questionable at best Leon stated do nt tell me that my fing services are questionable . I would nt even give them a star if you did nt have to . I would suggest going to your neighborhood mom and pops service center over this place .

As much as I 'd love to rave about this product 's performance because I lost 5 lbs . in two weeks , after that period of time the product stopped working altogether so I was sorely disappointed because it amounted to no more than other products that are considered fads , as they too are known to give results for a limited amount of time before they no longer work . In this case just as in those cases , the product no longer stops working , you also regain the lost weight with some accompanying pounds to make you slightly heavier than you were when you first used the product .I was offered a really good coupon from the seller and it is too bad that the product is a nogo elsewise I would have taken advantage of the coupon .It would not be fair for me to recommend this product to anyone based upon the few pounds it temporarily helped me to use and so my recommendation would be to not bother .	0

These are the most uncomfortable shoes ever . Maybe it 's just my feet I got these and a boot , thinking I 'd see which was more comfortable I have a bruised , damaged ball of my foot and I ca n't walk in regular shoes right now .

i will make sure i tell everyone i know never ever ever buy fandango gift cards . it 's a scam . when you try to use it in conjunction with a credit card , it shows you the balance that will be applied to your credit card but when you are done with the transaction , your credit card gets charged the entire amount and you are stuck with the gift card . fandango refuses to refund the gift card so i can pay towards the charge card . so now my charge bill is 52 instead of 17 and i 'm stuck with a 35 gift card . and of course when you go to use the 35 next time , fandango will make sure they get the fee per ticket leaving you with less than 35 . what a rip off if you really care about customer service you would call me instead of emailing me with an automated response . 732 674 6622 beverly ombres	0

DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR ONLINE FROM GWINNETT AUDI . CAR ARRIVED WITH DAMAGE NOT DISCLOSED BY DEALERSHIP . I purchased a 2016 Lexus IS200 t from Gwinnett Audi in February 2017 . Found the car online through cars . com , contacted Gwinnett , and the longdistance purchase experience was relatively painless . However , when the car was delivered to Texas , discovered that it had damage to the trunk lid and bumper which i did not show up on the pictures that they posted online and ii was not disclosed by the Sales Representative . The second we saw the car as it was being unloaded by the transporter , called the Sales Rep . She said she would look into it . Couple of weeks went by and did not hear from her . Following up she said it was out of her department and then that she was no longer with Gwinnett Audi . Placed calls to Sales Manager and General Manager with no success in getting them to call back . Finally talked to Sales Manager and offered a nominal sum to fix the bumper , but only 1 / 4 of the total estimate to fix the bumper and the trunk lid . Told me to get an estimate so I did and when told them the amount , Sales Manager basically laughed and said there is no way they would pay that . Sales Manager also said that I had not claim . . . and that . . . they were a big corporation who had inhouse lawyers to deal with me . Then forwarded estimate . Got no reply . Emailed Sales Manager and General Manager again , no reply . Even worse , its been 60 days since I bought the car and the Finance Department wo n't send me a copy of my Purchase Contract or registration for vehicle so driving with expired dealer plates and will probably get cited by police and / or have to pay a penalty when I go register the Lexus in Texas assuming they ever get the registration done . When credit union sent me title on trade in by mistake , Gwinnett 's Finance Manager called basically demanding that send it to them ASAP . I FEDEXED to them at my own expense . But when I need something , crickets . HORRIBLE AFTER THE SALE CUSTOMER SERVICE .	0
Great ExperienceI drove 4 hours from Greenville , NC to purchase a 2017 Mercedes GLE350 from Dick Dyer . I called to check availability with Roy Chaney and he went over car and pricing . He also was able to complete my trade in figure via text with Hank Dyer giving me the total payment and certified warranty . This is the most honest and fair dealer I have ever done business with .	1
I was very disappointed with this product . I saw a few other reviews of disappointed buyers however there were a few very positive reviews so I figured I would give it a shot . Sad to say I was very disappointed as well . It gets 1 star because of the fast delivery . To start the product was too tight ! I viewed the sizing chart and ordered within my weight range however I would advise anyone if you still would like to try these out order a size up . They were terribly difficult putting on and once they were on it gave barely if any additional lift . Maybe this will work for some ladies with very little back there but for the average to bigger booty woman looking for a little more voluptous look it just does nt work .	0
Great service always	1

Lithothamnion calcareum OR Aquamin in 1000 mg sold by TruNature an exclusive Costco brand , Now Foods and many other supplement producers was achieved by a study to determine whether a mineral extract derived from the red marine algae could be used as a dietary supplement for prevention of bone mineral loss on sixty mice Yes only sixty male / female mice divided into three groups with and without HFWD . To understand the damaging effects of calcium supplements on human body read Medical Journals of EU . Costco has been pushing this supplement for over a year and has not even been able to receive a single review on their site . Vitamin A and Calcium are the most damaging nutrients in form of supplements but no harm in form of natural food . Infact the damages of respiratory system are so high that even smokers in EU are advised not to take the supplements . Link in comment section .	0

Purchasing a RX450 from Lexus Mr . Tony AbizeidMr Abizeid is a polite professional well informed sales man who made my buying process very smooth and successful . He is knowledgeable and extremely polite and courteous . He presented several choices to me and never grew frustrated with my constant questions . He presented several different choices to me and the options therein . In fact Mr Abizeid first contacted me to make me aware of the great incentive program Lexus had available at this time in my Lease . . Had he not called me I would never have known of this great program . He saved me a great deal and got me into a wonderful car all in polite professional manner . He is the best car salesman I have ever dealt with .	1

This was a very dissapointing purchase . This bra is not at all what it is glammed up to be . Material is cheap and the bra is not well constructed to support the full figured woman .

This is what happens when you move a quality product from the US to a foreign country for manufacture . I 've worn Levi 's 501 's since before they were even called 501 's over 60 years and this product is not a Levi 501 . It is pure garbage and I 've ordered my last pair . It really is a bummer to see what is happening to so many American products that are shipped overseas to cheap labor manufacturers . I would even advocate a boycott of Levi until they return to the quality that made them famous . . .Now I have to search for a replacement . . .Maybe I 'll try Wranglers . . . . .	0

I wish I could give them 4 stars . . . one star for each time I walked the showroom floor or outside to look at cars and they all ignored me . I brought my car for a service appointment on June 19th . It 's a lease and the lease runs out within a year so I figured I would see what they have to offer and plan my next car . I went to the showroom and immediately started checking out the blue GLE , walking around it a few times . Then I walked to the other end where the cars are located . The girl at the front desk did n't acknowledge me , nor did the guy coming towards me from one of the backrooms / offices . I walked outside and checked out the new GLE 's on the lot between MB and Infiniti . . . still nothing . I walked over to Infiniti and was looking at the QX80 and the Q70L . Within 5 minutes of me being out there , a man named Carlos came out and gave me a business card , which made me happy because it was starting to sprinkle a little bit , but he still was looking to make a sale . I walked back to MB , in through the front door and still , nobody said welcome or asked if I needed anything . I looked at the cars for a second time , again with a focus on the blue GLE . This time , I was even getting in and out of the car to see what it was like . Jan Villela just sat at her desk , the man on her right just sat in there on his cell phone , the woman on the left was on her computer , probably working . I went back to the service waiting room and talked to the service guy , Stephen . Now , there are signs everywhere that talk about a Trade Up Program . I stood in front of one of these signs right in front of Mark Gray 's cubicle as he 's sitting there shooting the breeze with another worker . I read this sign from top to bottom giving him plenty of time to ask me if I had any questions . He did n't even acknowledge my presence . I would do this one other time with the same results . I go and sit back down . A little while later , I get up and go back to the same blue GLE for a third time and head back out the front door and look at some of the used ones facing MLK . I hop in and out of a few cars , there 's one sales member out there . . . does n't acknowledge my presence . I walk back in through the front door , there 's about five people sitting / standing around the front desk . . . not a single one said anything to me . Same thing , I walk around the blue GLE and still nothing from anybody . By this point , I 've been here for around 2 . 5 hours no worries , my car was being serviced and I 've been nothing but ignored . I sit back down and decide to check out the blue GLE for a fourth time and walk outside to the used GLEs and nobody said anything to me . There were three people in the corner office by the Gwagon planning their lunch two guys , one girl . . . she had to explain to the one that the other guy was still fasting . . . the guy was surprised that he was still doing it to which she informed him that it lasted for one month . . . good for you , way to understand other people 's culture . In short , I was looking for ways to spend 60 , 000 today on a new car in the 3 hours I was waiting for my car to be serviced , but they apparently did n't want my money . All of this can be verified by your cameras . . . I was the dude with the red ballcap . Albeit , I 'm sure I do n't look like a typical Benzo driver , but I know I could 've walked out the door with a 60 , 000 SUV today if someone wanted to play ball . When my lease is up , I 'm going to slide those keys back across the desk , walk out , and talk to my guy Carlos at Infiniti . I am absolutely disgusted by how I was treated at this place . You have just lost a customer .	0

I wish I could say that this is a great product that met my expectations but I 'd be doing a disservice to anyone that had the same results from using it as I did . . . I would n't wish that on but a few folks I have ever known but most of them are already dead anyway . . What I experienced was an increase in blood pressure , irregular heartbeat , non stop head congestion , runny nose , trembling hands and dry mouth . . . I was okay in a couple of days but those are days I could have done without .	0

I ca nt comment on the product as i ve never used them . The one that comes with the phone is more than acceptable and is already attached so no worries about bubbles , its also not even remotely come off . Just ensure you cut the top of the pull off plastic though to ensure you do nt catch it . i ve had this phone a year now .Its an interesting question , why do nt they put these on in the factory ? you do nt have lint or quality issues associated with buying and applying third party covers . If you do nt want it you simply remove it .	0

I am a dealer in Arlington and I also know lots of dealers here in Arlington , all of us dealers here in Arlington buy parts from Irving or other dealers in Fort Worth and the reason is the worker in charge of the part sales is very bad with his manners and service . I do n't know his name but he 's bold and white and heavy in weight . All the other departments in Kia or Hyundai or chevy or Ford are very nice . Before one year there was another worker before him he was very nice but this particular guy is very rude .	0
I moved to Bakersfield a couple years ago and have always taken my Chevy Cruz to be serviced at a dealership . That was a terrible decision . The customer service is terrible , when I dropped off my car the advisors seem bothered that that had to help someone . Advisors never answer the phone and never return calls . The service department has lost my business and I will happily drive out of town to make sure I purchase my next Chevy at a different dealership .	0

It might not seem like a big deal which tissue you get for your winter cold but it does . I got my first cold of the season and after a couple of days everything felt like sandpaper on my nose . I started using the Puffs plus lotion facial tissues and it was a very noticeable improvement to how I felt . The lotion sooths the soreness and makes blowing your nose not seem like a life or death experience . The tissues hold up well during use and do n't fall apart .If you have a cold save yourself the frustration and pain just purchase the Puffs Plus with lotion out of the gate . Your nose will thank you .	1

Do n't plan on taking these pills and dropping weight , that wo n't happen . Well , I guess over months it may . But if you exercise , even moderately , these will help a lot . Obviously the more you exercise , the more calories you burn and the more you crave food intake to curb those cravings . This dramatically reduces that and helps that caloric deficiency , stay a deficiency . Be sure to drink a lot of water and not to take them close to bed . I 've lost over 10lbs in a month with good dieting and taking these .	1

Spirulina is LOADED with PURINES that raise uric acid levels hugely ! I never had any gout symptoms in my life until I started taking spirulina a couple of years ago . After a week or two , I started having bizarre and scary pain in my toes during the night and in the morning . I researched and discovered that spirulina has an extremely high purine content purines uric acid gout . My symptoms disappeared the day after I stopped taking it .I had never had gout before , and no one in my family has ever had it . No human group has ever been known to eat spirulina , except Mayans / Aztecs who ate it in small amounts before battle , and destitute people in Chad who harvest it from a lake .Spirulina is 99 marketing , and 1 health benefit .	0

There are both quality and quality control issues with this product . I bought 3 of them for 3 the Optimus Vs my family owns . They do n't fit properly . Top right corner does not close completely . After about 3 weeks of use without ever dropping it the bottom corners developed cracks and then small pieces began to come off . Almost impossible to remove and reinstall without ruining the little tabs that lock the halves together . Conclusion If you 're one of the lucky ones who gets one that fits , it wo n't last long . Do n't waste you time / money on this product .	0

This is a reasonable price for such a great product . I have other brands . All HSS Himalayan Sea Salt is great . This one has a great price . HSS does not raise my blood pressure and whether I use more or less , it pleases my palate .

I use the HSS lamps to purify the air and the HSS chunks in foot baths . I make sole to alkalize my body . Thanks to Toran McCoy and Lauren for introducing me to HSS and Isabella at Solay Wellness for introducing me to the other uses for HSS . And to Spice Lab and Solay for keeping their prices down .	1
I have been a customer of Vista BMW Coconut Creek for 10 years and I only take my cars to them for service .

It helps that I get a loaner too , but the service is 5 star from the moment I pull up . I take pride in maintaining my vehicles and Tom does too ! Thank you for always being there !	1

We went in with a gift card that had no expiration date . The card was two Christmases ago but again no expiration on it . Well the new gift cards were different so therefore ours was automatically no good . 25 . 00 gift card no good because oh we do n't even use those anymore . That 's old . Well so am I and I still get used . BUT . . . . . here 's my problem , no apology , no well wishes , did n't even look at me while I 'm talking to her , just walks away , as in sorry bout your luck . I tell her that is one of your 25 . 00 gift cards without an expiration date . She says ya still not . . good . I get that all HD shops are rich now and do n't need customers anymore which works out perfectly for me as I will NEVER spend another dime there ! , But the lack of customer service . . . . and bless her little heart . . . . . she needs to realize she wo n't have her hotsie little ass forever .

I purchased this after reading the reviews . I have been looking for something anything to help reduce the problem and provide longlasting pain relief .

Thankfully my problem is almost cleared up , but I would definitely recommend this product .	1

Poor customer serviceThe models I was interested they had them all listed over msrp and were n't willing to negotiate down . I was trading in a car and they had my keys . When they came back with their offer I said I would n't be interested at that price and asked for my keys so I could leave . The sales guy left and came back about 5 minutes later with a different offer and still without my keys . At this point they are holding me there against my will by not returning my personal property so I can leave . So I have to ask again , much less polite , for the keys to the car I own so I could be on my way . Probably another 3 minutes go by and some other guy comes to the table to give me my keys and tried to present another offer . Did n't wait to see his offer , just grabbed my keys and left . Was n't a friendly or welcoming experience , if I am to consider a Kia again I will drive 130 miles out of my way to the dealer in Waterloo before considering giving any business to these people .	0

When I received this as a review sample I thought it was a novelty and not a real charger because of the size it measures a Lilliputian 2 inhes long exclusive or the spring leaded contact point , and protrudes less than an inch when it 's plugged into a socket .What I love , though , is it is fast . I tested it with a Galaxy Note 3 in the 1 Amp port and a Tab 3 10 .1 tablet in the 2 .4 Amp port and both charged as fast as the high speed charger I normally use in my car .I also tried charging with the devices switched in the ports , with the tablet in the 1 Amp and the phone in the 2 .4 Amp . They both Charged simultaneously . I should note that when I test my phone I do so with music streaming and GPS turned on . Some chargers actually can not keep up with the discharge rate during that test . This one did .The reason why I awarded this five stars is the integrated protection that will s down charging if it detects voltage issues high or low , and when your device is fully charged . More and more chargers are showing up with those features , but not as small as this or in this price range . That I know about , anyway .	1

This seriously stinks ! I used to buy these but the price has almost tippled . That 's insane ! I guess chia seeds have become too popular for them to be cheap anymore . Before , I could rely on chia seeds to be the most affordable of the things in my health regimen , but not anymore . It used to cost .37 cents per ounce , now it 's 1 .45 . PER OUNCE ! UPDATE The price dropped by a lot since writing my review but these still cost nearly 25 more then when I first bought them last year .Who knows , maybe because of the demand they are not as easy for the sellers to get , but if so that should at least be explained in the item description . Right ? Otherwise it just looks like pure greed and a company that I do n't want to give my business to .	0

I absolutely love the smell of this oil . I can smell the cinnamon primarily over any other oil , and when you add this to a steamer inhaler to breathe into your lungs , it is the most delicious smelling and 34tasting34 steam worked wonders to help break up phlegm in my chest . The price seems a little high and has exactly the same ingredients and smell as 34Thieves34 , so if you can find Thieves cheaper elsewhere , buy it . Overall , I am glad I bought it and would buy again if I can find it at a better price .	1

These batteries are just like the coppertop ones that Duracell advertises except you buy them in a different cardboard box much better than the stupid cellophane covered packaging you get at the stores which can be a challenge to both open and then keep the batteries from going all over the place . But back to the batteries , Duracell , as far as I am concerned , is the best battery manufacturer in that the batteries are well made and last as long as any batteries on the market . Having said that , I did get a batch of 34bad34 Duracell coppertop that did leak some acid I took back to the merchant and got new ones , but they were AA batteries . If you check the price of these and get free shipping through Amazon Prime , these are cheaper than most of the other size C batteries on the market that are high quality .	1

When I first ordered a case for my Galaxy Note 3 , I did n't want to pay 30 50 . I really liked the idea of the Samsung Folio style case with autowake feature . But . . .But , what I found is that case offered almost no protection . And the autowake feature used battery life and did n't always work .I almost immediately had a mishap with my larger NOTE 3 phone as I drove the phone into a side of the table , that originally case was open on the sides and that was the last time I used that case .I ordered two more cases online , one was otterbox like and I hated it . The other was ultra slim and again , offered virtually no protection . THIS IS A BIG PHONE . And it is an expensive phone . And I believe a case should be able to handle small mishaps . Oh , not big things . . . that is why the otterbox type case was just too much . It ruined the phone .Then this Spigen Bounce came to my notice . Oh , wonderful .Already it has taken a jolt from a three foot table to a hard , unforgiving ceramic tile floor hitting squarely on the corner of the case . Oh , no ! As I watched in horror after my earlier problem , I picked up the phone and not even the case was marred . Nothing . Perfect condition . I ca n't say much more . This case does what I want .I like the case too . I think the back is stylish and unique and the front nearly disappears , but provides that needed bezel for setting a phone on a table and still keep the screen protected . I even love the buttonless buttons . I thought I would hate that . But they work so well that you got to like the sleek look it adds to the phone case .Some things I think you will like Very lightweight and slim . Almost no weight added to the phone . nonslippery TPU casing , I have loved holding my phone ever since I put it on . Sorry , but the phone just did n't feel right til then . You can safely lay the phone facedown on a table , desk , etc , as the bezel elevates . Being able to take the SPen out of the phone easily was important for me . . . five stars here . The manufacture by Spigen , my new favorite case manufacturer is clean and good . Precision cuts for openings . Simple to put on and to remove when needed . Still , it does n't have a problem of exposing edges or sides ! one case I ordered just was n't stiff enough to protect the LONG sides of this phone , leaving the edges uncovered anytime it was being handled . It was cheap . Excuse me , it is well priced . Yes , I know this is just some TPU and engineering design , but this design makes a very useful and beneficial case . I love it . Well worth the price . And still slim and attractive . . . something I did n't want to give up . BOUNCE . Yep . Bounce . The name of the case . And if the case allows a 700 phone to bounce off a hard tile floor , that is something to love at such a inexpensive price ! Enjoy !	1
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .	0

This is heavy , and since I have major muscle problems it is sometimes awkward to hold but boy does it provide relief ! it feels great ! i wish it had heat as well . The rollers are heavy duty getthejob done , The green 34point34 is for shiatsu style relief I do n't use it much but glad it 's there . The green bumpy area on the back of this massager is great for my hands I hold that part in my hand and the vibrations are very soothing .	1
early in december ( i believe around the 5th ) i ordered two gift cards from the fandango website to send to grand children in colorado . i figured that the cards would be part of a movie fun gift they could open . 10 days later heard nothing . found out that two simple gift cards were mailed out 5 ( ! ! ! ! ) days after i placed the order and could expect delivery about ten days affter mailing . i cancelled the order and bought another gift card from a competitor . i was very disappointed that it would take so long and then no notification either at point of sale or as the process went on . fortunately i followed up and a real problem was averted .	0
product arrived quickly and well packaged . as a big believer in supplements , I give this product 5 stars .	1

I have gained serious muscle on this product . Also , I feel like an animal at the gym due to my ability to push through a set like an animal . Be aware there is micronized creatine that may be better due to better absorbtion , but it might just be nitpicking . As I said , I have loved the product . Take with a simple carb to get an insulin spike for better abosrbtion . 2 .5 g twice a day , no loading .	1
Is n't everyone of you CONVINCED THAT THIS PRODUCT IS ALL NATURAL FREE OF ANY SYNTHETIC ISOLATES ? Is n't THIS THE REASON that you CHOOSED it and highly paid for it ? Of course , included myself , THATS WHAT THEY WANT US TO BELIEVE , and they manage well . . . . . .please try to contact them and ask . . .if you 'll ever manage to get an answer you will be surprised . . ! ! If i was living in USA , i would bring forward this matter for legal investigation , not because these companies use what they use , it 's their right to use what ever is legaly available in the market , as all common synthetic vitamin producers , but because in a very sophisticated , elaborated way they mislead , they take off you the right to choose what you swallow by disguising the truth . And i consider sometimes this may be risky , there are people with allergies and intolerances . . . . .After research and a lot of effords to have an answer from New Chapter regarding the kind of ingredientsvitamins they use for their cultivations . . . , came out that they DO use SYNTHETIC isolates eg . B12 cyanocobalamin , the cheapest , less absorbable form of b12 , the toxic cyanin . . . ! just to mention one , as well as oxide minerals ! magnesium , zinc oxide etc . .They said yes we use them , but we cultivate them with food , yeast . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Well its not nice to be treated as a fool , what ever cultivation is done the fact is that the less effective CHEAPEST FORMS OF SYNTHETIC vitamins are used , and the final amound of vitamins in these supplements , is NOT the result of Pure Food Process , as i was so glad to beleive at first place . . . and i guess all of you too . . .After all , i do nt think that the toxic cyanid . . . evaporates in the final product ! When somebody goes for a high quality NATURAL product , presented in this masterpiece way , and available to pay that much , expects and needs in first hand that no synthetic isolates are used or , if this is the only way , at least the synthetic vitamins used , to be mentioned and be of the safest effective , absorbable , non toxic forms , eg .vit .B12 as Methylcobalamin , or hydroxycobalamin , vit .B6 as P5P . . . etc .Yes of course these forms cost much more , but This for me is called ETHIC .The question is , if companies like New Chapter and Megafood they also use harmfull binders as stearates , hidden under the name vegetable lubricants ! , are disguising truths in that way , presenting their products as NATURAL , WHOLE FOOD which kind of supplements should i trust ? Well after all this research , i ended up to believe , that the best safest way to supplement , is either certified Organic Green formulas , that they have all kinds of vitamins , minerals and aminoacids in natural form anyway , or choose products thatFirst they mention all the ingredients analytically and have no fear to answer about them , andSecond they use the highest quality first ingredients available . without use of binders and fillers , etc ofcourse , yes , . . .there are a couple of companies like this , For me , these are the important criterions to understand the quality of the final product , besides the GMP certificates and awards . . . . .	0

i think it is absurd that you charge a convenience fee to order tickets online . you should be encouraging e commerce not discouraging it . take a lesson from retail banking in how they are disdained by their customers for senseless fees in the name of convenience . thank you very much for the offer to charge me a convenience fee but i 'll just buy at the box office kiosk for free .	0
Like several other reviewers , I purchased this product thinking it would be the same as the White Flower Oil imported and distributed by Solstice Medicine that I had bought for years at Whole Foods , then when they dropped the product , via Amazon . Caveat Emptor ! This is another product which has entered the realm of the gray market .The 34real34 product has the original label and is manufactured by Hoe Hin Pak Fah Yeow Manufactory Ltd . in Hong Kong and distributed in the U .S . by Solstice Medicine in Los Angeles . The real product has Solstice Medicine printed on the back label , at least on the 0 .67 oz . , 20 ml bottle size . That is the description of this product , but when I purchased it from Seller Low Voltage and MORE ! , the product was seemingly only about 10 as strong as I had been buying for the last several years , and offered no relief for my aching feet . The seller did refund my money but what I really need and want is the ORIGINAL PRODUCT ! Only by contacting solsticemeddotcom did I find a local reseller , but since they are 22 miles away , I have not yet made the investment to see if it is possible to buy the original product by getting it from the US distributor as I usually have done .	0
My service advisor , Halton Martinez , is the best , and always has been . But other staff that I deal with during my visits are great too .

Again I say Do nt let the cheap price scare you away , it is not Tiffany , but it is truthfully a very nice pretty necklace worth gift giving and even buying for your self !	1

This is an absolutely fantastic solution to charging your Apple products in your car ! First , I love the fact that it not only has a charger for an iPhone 4 or iPad in addition to an additional USB port for an additional device to be charged . This has been very helpful for my husband and I to charge both our phones . I charged my iPad with this charger only one device charging at the same time and it charged at the same speed my iPad charges with the standard wall charger , so it has a good deal of power and helps your phones charge quickly .In addition I absolutely love the design and the material . It is this strange rubbery material that does n't get scratched or damaged , so it holds up well in your car we have stepped on and broken a couple of the harder plastic charger ports already . But the cord itself is the real genius to this charger . It is wide and flat so it NEVER gets tangled either upon itself or with another cord ! I absolutely love this charger and will be buying more for stocking stuffers this holiday season !	1

well , for starters , our family has purchased many tickets ahead of time to sit together and plan especially a holiday time or blockbuster movie . this year , only a few of us could do it , so we purchased tickets 10 days in advance for christmas day hobbit 2 00p . m . we arrived around 1 15 and were told to stand in a certain line . we only found out that the theatre ( century greenback ) changed the time to 1 30 were already watching the movie . the could care less attitude employee said it happens sometimes when you book with fandango and the theatre changes the time also were told we could go see the 5p . m . show problem is christmas day busy people ( the reason we pay extra for fandango ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) needless to say only 1 2 of us got to go the others disappointed . funny , fandango also emailed my husband who purchased the 4 tickets of the 2p . m . show reminding us of the time . long story short why use your service anymore , pay extra and have some young uncaring employee be rude . thanks	0

Decided to call and ask about an Audi that would be a good fit for me . The guy kept interrupting me while I was talking and never told me a vehicle that would fit my driving practice . He was just like I have customers now so come in and we can get you a car . I 'm just looking for a car in the future and needed help , but I could tell they only cared about their bottom line . They was n't interested in selling me a car I would be happy with , just any car so they can celebrate a sale . Not going through this shady dealership . I will most likely go through St Louis instead . Longer drive , but probably better people .	0
After reading so many positive reviews about simethicone , I bought this product certain that it would work . When two weeks went by with no positive results , I figured it was me . One thing might work for one person , but not another , and that 's not unusual . So I turned to Mayo and Maryland and examined their double and triple blind clinical trials . All of them declared that there was no statistically meaningful difference between taking simethicone and taking a placebo . The studies did mention , however , three other antigas ingredients that are fairly successful , and even arranged them in order of success . All three are available in Amazon products .	0

On October 11 , 2017 I was in the market for a new white or silver Hyundai Accent Hatchback . Edmond Hyundai was the only dealer in the metro that had what I wanted and I 'm glad they did because I had a good experience with them . It was worth the 20 mile drive from my home in Moore . I have bought over 10 cars from dealerships . I am no stranger to the process . My salesperson Frank was knowledgeable , friendly , and ready to sell me a car , no gimmicks . Sandy in customer service is very friendly and does her job well too . As does Michael in finance . I have family and friends that drive Hyundai 's and now I do too . This is my first and likely not my last . Edmond will be worth the drive when I am in need again . Thank you for a pleasant , quick , and efficient experience .	1

These are durable great quality brush heads that last much longer than any manual toothbrush or electronic toothbrush head I have ever used , no matter the cost ! I am convinced that it actually saves me money to own the Pulsonic electronic toothbrush because these heads are so durable and longlasting , not to mention the savings on future professional dental visits because they work so well . I have never even had a bristle come off and get stuck in my teeth as I have with other brands !	1

For the price I was n't expecting much , but this is a really nice basic case . It feels like good quality and does n't add a lot of bulk to the phone . Cutouts match up fine . It looks pretty much as pictured . I like the glossy finish and the blue color , which adds a bit of color without being excessively loud . It goes well with the pebble blue phone . The screen protector is also decent and was easy to install .	1

I have numerous Keen 's both hiking and sandals . All are very comfortable except for this model . The bit between the toes hurt and my toes hit the end of the toe guard . Granted I have to take a 10 in all my Keen shoes but I have never worn anything larger than a 9 in a flip flop . I have a very , very narrow foot and anything larger would n't stay on . This all said I think they would have been fine if the toes were open . I probably would have gotten used to the part between my toes . But , they just did n't work .	0
I received my 2 bottles fast , only to discover that they would expire in less than a month . So , I would n't even have a chance to see if it works .

I sent another message , asking why because amazon still shows this for sale , and now they are not responding to my message . It 's VERY frustrating , because I really wanted to try this product .	0

I 'm training for a 5 K so I can not speak to long distance and these socks and I have been trying out a couple different types of socks to see which work best . I have Brooks running shoes in a wide so it is important that any sock I wear be comfortable for my short and wide feet . My feet are also small size 5 womens and many socks are just too big and do n't fit right .These are absolutely perfect . They are n't too tight across the arch a problem I had with another brand that made me feel like my arch was strangled ! and the heel area is just perfect . I had no seam annoyance whatsoever while running . I had also been having some heel pain pretty minor . .more soreness and once I started running in these socks that was gone . Saved me buying another pair of running shoes because I thought it was the shoes but turns out was my pair of socks not providing enough cushion or something . I swap out with several different types of Balega socks and all have been winners except the thin one 's which were very good but lacked something to make them stand out and be purchased over less costly options .These are superb and worth every penny . I wear a 6 1 / 2 in a running shoe and got these in Small . They fit perfectly . Highly recommended !	1

Unnecessary credit checkThey were accommodating and professional , but when I told them I was paying cash they insisted on running a credit check . After I made my purchase I decided to do some research on this subject . Dealer credit checks are not required if you are paying cash or if you already have credit lined up through your bank or credit union . They will use several excuses to run a hard credit check but in reality it 's all about increasing their profit based on what they can get out of you . Hard credit checks stay on your report for 2 years . . . limiting what possible future loans or rates you may receive .	0
This Yubi Power Bank is just the right size for taking along in my handbag . Portable battery packs like these are so handy when you have a smartphone you use quite a bit throughout the day . Like most people , I use my phone an iPhone 4s for so much more than just talking to people . Each day my phone is tasked with everything from checking emails to ordering things online . Should I want to listen to music , use the maps / GPS applications , listen to iHeartRadio or play some application games , my phone 's battery drains even faster . But plugging it in to a wall outlet to charge half way through the day is not always an option . That 's where a little battery pack like this come in so handy .A bit longer than a tube of lipstick , it actually more resembles long lipgloss tubes . This means is will easily fit into even the smallest of handbags . It 's great when I 'm out going places for the day , or meeting with someone , and all I have with me is my purse . I can plug my iPhone into this to charge it , while it sits right inside my bag . This lets me keep my phone with me , and not have to leave it in my car to charge via a carcharger .These small chargers are such a great idea . Bags , briefcases or even just inside your pocket , it will fit anywhere and is a realistic way to take along extra power for your phone , or any other device you can charge via USB . Very handy and invaluable for smartphone users .A sample unit was provided for reviewing purposes .	1

We were on a cross country ride when my crank position sensor went bad . Called them and told them we were forty five minutes away on a Saturday . They said they were closing in thirty minutes and would n't open back up until Tuesday . They would not wait for us to get there . Let them pick the bike up Tuesday and asked them to check out the codes . They charged me for a new battery saying mine was bad . What they did n't know was that I had just had the battery tested at another dealer and it was fine . They charged me 439 . 00 and said I was good to go . Started down the road and none of the electrical issues were fixed . I have traveled to all 48 states and in my opinion they are the worst excuse for a dealership I have encountered . If that 's the way the dealers are going to treat their riders my next bike wo n't be a Harley . BTW , I am owner , operator of a successful bike shop and know when I have been done wrong .	0

ZERO CARBS and no gassy sideeffects . I 'm on a low carb diet I use 1 cup of Almond Milk and 1 / 2 cup of water to 1 scoop of this protein shake . I drink it just before I leave work because that 's when I make bad food decisions .	1
This is a very cheaply made case that does not fit the iPhone 5C very well at all . If you want a fullbody protective case , you are better off with the LifeProof or , if that is too expensive , the Otterbox . Do n't bother with this .	0
I have been looking for a BMW for months when I finally saw it on car guru . In summary they listed the car I wanted in multiple sites on the web etc . for a great price . I spoke with my sales person several times making sure the car was still available etc . he then looked it over for and said it was perfect . When I was about to drive 80 miles to see it I was told the car no longer was for sale and had gone to auction . I then spoke with the head of sales , , related him the story , but he said it was gone since the evening before ? Then he said he could n't sell it because an air bag needed replacing . I asked why he just did n't fix they are supposed to be a car dealership , or let me do it on my ownit . . . no response , Surely to me would be better taking my money instead of auction . Basically I feel strongly and that they were not a all truthful , and used the BMW as a teaser . My advice would be do NOT do business here , IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING IT AS YOUR DEALERSHIP GOOD LUCK AND GET IT ALL IN WRITING .	0

when I got the palm pre i knew that the beautiful screen , multitasking , bluetooth streaming , constant facebook , myspace , and text checks would eat the little included battery alive four hours tops with all above mentioned .with the seidio extended battery all day , with 30 to spare at night .and it gives the phone a sturdy feel . the rubberized coating is perfect .if you have a pre and intend to use it like a laptop like i do , get this battery . best . . .i've spent in a while .	1

I 've had an Omron arm blood pressure monitor ever since I was diagnosed with HBP which was about 20 years ago . This was easy to use but it was necessary for you to remove your jacket , sweater or long sleeve shirt before taking your reading . Now with the wrist monitor , checking your blood pressure is quick and easy . I like the features of the ability to keep readings and settings for two people and the light is a reminder to place your wrist in the correct position .	1
Great . .fit is perfect .	1
The best car dealership experience bar none thanks to Shirley Chen and Priscila Tsun . Walking in to BMW Bayside I was far from set on leasing a BMW , but after sitting down with Shirley it was the clear choice for me . She worked with me to find the perfect car and lease agreement . The process of finding the right car at the right price was smooth and easy something I have not experienced at any of the other dealerships I 've visited .	1

These arrived yesterday and he tried them on and said that they are very comfortable although he has not worn them outdoors yet for walking . He has had this brand before and really liked them , also because they are waterproof and warm in colder weather . We walk outdoors in the wintertime a lot and he wanted a warm waterproof boot for winter wear . He also plans to wear them to work because he can wear casual wear at work and these are more comfortable than dress shoes .	1
what happened to fandango ? you hit the movie , no pic of the actors in it , no reviews , no plot and story of what it 's about ? new layout terrible	0

I 'm all for inexpensive things . . . but I still appreciate quality . Do n't trust the picturethese are super thin . They create air bubbles like crazy . Even if you think you 've removed every trace of dust from your phone surface , as soon as you put the screen on , the screen will find any spec of dust within a 15 foot radius and create a huge air bubble around itpreferably right in the middle of your screenthat will annoy you daily as you use your phone . You can try to push the air bubbles out to the edge , but these screen protectors do n't work that way and your efforts will be futile .These screen protectors are also magnets for fingerprints and the natural oils that our skin produces . They love it . They love to give you a nice , smeary look on your otherwise impeccable iPhone screen .These is a reason why you get three in this pack for such a low price THE COMPANY IS GIVING THEM AWAY .You know what I do like though ? I like that there is a protector for the back of the phone as well . Even when I replace the front onewhich I absolutely will because these air bubbles and fingerprints are the bane of my existenceI will probably keep the back one . It has the same issues with the air bubbles and fingerprints , but at least I do n't look at the back side nearly as much as I do the front .	0
I purchased this in hope the reviews that said it glowed were correct , unfortunately they were not . I tried editing my settings but nothing worked .	0

These blades did not live up to the level of quality I have learned to expect from Gillette .Normally , I am able to use 1 Mach3 Turbo blade 3 x if I clean the blades with rubbing alcohol between each use . This sort of cost saving manuever proves to be effective , if , and only if I shave every day ca n't skip a day .These blades did not seem sharp and would shave clean only one time . Second attempt is a painful hair pulling experience .Something 's wrong with the glide strips . They provide more friction than prevent .Gillette products are found in nearly every country imaginable why on earth are the blades I purchase in Eastern Europe far superior to those sold in the United States ? ? ?	0

One would conclude that in purchasing a 34Samsung standard battery34 with a picture of a Samsunglabeled battery and a claim that the manufacturer is Samsung that one would be getting a Samsung OEM Battery . And even if it were a knockoff , many would forgive or overlook if it actually worked .Since this had a cleverly counterfeited label Samsung is in Korea , not China . And the OEM label is silverfish / gray , not white , I could keep my mouth shut if it worked . BUT IT DOESN'T WORK . It did n't hold a charge , and it caused the phone to keep shutting down . Clue 1 that this was garbage was the packaging itself , which was nothing more than a regular envelope wrapped folded around the battery and sealed with scotch tape . Return address is some house in East Blythe , California that Zillow estimates is worth 400k .So some guy is selling counterfeit , defective garbage out of his house on Amazon , claiming the manufacturer is Samsung .Save your money . And way to go Amazon , well done . Thanks for nothing ,	0

These might provide the best nutritional benefit of any vitamin , but I 'll never know because the smell is so bad I ca n't stomach them . It 's a rotten fishy smell . I 've tried swallowing them quickly , holding my nose , etc . . but the smell is still there and will come up later , and this smell makes my stomach turn to the point of vomiting . No other vitamin or supplement has ever done this to me .Why they do n't coat these , or incapsulate them , or deal with this smell in some way I 'll never know . A maggot would be offended .	0

I 'm a big fan of Charmin Ultra . I can do without a lot of superfluous niceties , but toilet paper is one product where I do n't mind paying a higher price for a better product . This is n't it . My local grocery was out of the Ultra , so I chose this in the name of research . Oops . It 's singleply , with very little texture and no softness or absorbency at all , compared to my usual . When I spun it off the roll , I immediately thought 34commercial toilet paper ! 34 . Seriously , this is just like the stuff you 'd find in the restroom at a campground . Charmin Ultra is like sitting on a cloud . This Charmin is like sitting in the rain . It 'll do the job , but so will leaves , right ? Leaves are probably more absorbent than this , too . It 's the only toilet paper I 've ever had in my home that seemed like it would never run out , no matter how much I wanted it to . If , like me , you 're a toilet paper snob , treat your booty better than this .	0
for what it s worth , i was going to order tickets on line to see the movie lincoln tonight with my wife but we changed our mind after noticing an additional convenience fee . one would think you would want to make it as covenant as possible to order tickets , however paying an additional fee to order tickets on line makes me feel like i am being taken advantage of , as such we changed our minds . tonight we have elected to stay home and order a hd movie via vudu , not only was the price of admission less , our concessions will be less expensive as well .	0
This is a very attractive watch that I wear on a daily basis . It is easy for me to put on , and it is very comfortable .

This is a handy little battery pack . What sets it apart from the growing field of packs search and you will find lots is the attached charging cables . The cables nestle flat into slots on each side of the device , so when carried , it 's essentially a brick with no protrusions . This means one less thing to stuff into a pocket when heading off somewhere that I might need to charge on the go . I would swear that it charges an iPhone considerably faster than the Anker or Duracell power bricks I have used , but I have not actually tested that .	1

Alright , so i 've been using this detergent now for quite some time . I have figured out a lot about it and ca n't quite understand why it is getting such rave reviews from people who believe in its Free Gentle / Clear qualities .First off , it has a SCENT . Free Gentle / Clear means UNSCENTED . IT HAS BLEACH ! ! Wake up ! ! Secondly , my 8 month old breaks out in a huge rash after I use this detergent , do I have to go back to BORAX which is FREE CLEAR ! ! .Thirdly , it makes me itch like crazy .Here is how I do a wash cycle in my LG washer . . .Step 1 , Allergiene which is a nearly 2 hour wash . Step 2 , prewash . Step 3 , extra rinse . I fill up half of the drum only put in LINE 1 of detergent . With the extra rinse , I could use Amway , not free and clear and it does n't bother either one of us .I never really used tide much in my life . I thought with Free Gentle that I would be able to . I really wanted to like this detergent , as I am tired of not having the cleanest clothing . . . but it 's not what it is marketed as , and I 'm real tempted to SUE them for false advertisement .	0

This dealership is a joke . BEWARE ! ! ! ! ! We found a vehicle online that seemed perfect . Called the dealership and spoke to Bill . When asked the condition of the vehicle we were told it was Immaculate and the cleanest car they had ever had on the lot . The dealership knew we would be driving 300 miles to purchase the car . They assured us that it was in great shape . When we arrived we were not greeted by anyone . The car pulled up and we knew immediately that there was an issue . The car looked like hell . Dents and scraps everywhere . The carpet was filthy and it looked like someone had gone joy riding due to the caked on mud . Such a waste of our day . Not to mention the wear and tear on our vehicle to get down there . The car lot is very unprofessional and really needs to get it together . Nothing but a bunch of liars ! ! !	0

Technology seems over complicated . The 34free replacement34 is a false promise . The procedure to follow to get a 34free34 replacement costs you as much as a new set of screen protectors .

Anker sent me an open box unit with the seal broken in a plastic bag . The charger was scratched on the front . I 'm returning and avoiding Anker . What are they thinking treating people like this .

I 've purchased these types of cords before , but usually to get a low price , you have to wait weeks because they are coming from overseas !

And when one stops working I have kids . . .nuff said I have backups now ! Recommend !	1

Great adult gummy . Easy to chew , great tasting probably the best gummy vitamin I 've ever had , and decent offering of 15 essential nutrients . Also , very low sugar , which is something to remember when taking a gummy .

One star for service . For sales I would give 5 out 5 . They put scratch on my new rogue , overfilled oil . I heard some noise from under the hood , like metallic whistling .

Do n't do service at Nissan of Sacramento .	0
My wife and I saw some nice pricing on a used car for our daughter , so we drove to South Jordan to check them out . What we found out is that Discounted Price is really the As Is price before shop repairs . This is totally dishonest and false advertising in my opinion . The salesperson we spoke to told us that the pricing does n't include shop repairs which usually adds 1 , 000 or more to the discounted price . So basically the dealer brings in tradeins , without checking them out , prices them once you 're intrigued by the discounted price they upsell you on the repairs . I ca n't stand dealerships who lure people in to their business with dishonest tactics . Unacceptable practice .	0

I took this newlypurchased unit to my doctor 's office today . Compared to his measurement it measured my B .P . , both systolic and diastolic , as 1520 points higher than his . That wide a difference makes this unit , despite it 's superb features , worthless as a home B .P . monitor . And the problem could n't have been technique he checked the cuff positioning and tension and said it was being done properly the unit just does n't make a usable B .P . measurement compared to one to one taken manually . I 'm buying a manual B .P . measurement system instead and returning this to Amazon .	0

We had an appointment to go drive a car last night . We even called and talked to the finance people on our way there we had over an hour drive and we were told that they would pull the car up for us and the sales guy would be waiting for us . When we pulled into the parking lot , we saw people looking at the car we had an appointment to see . When we went inside to talk to our sales person , we were told that the other people walked onto the lot 5 minutes prior and to be fair they would get to test drive the car . Fox Mazda does not care that they set appointments and they will not hold a car for you to see . I will never step on this lot again and I caution people to not count on anything you are told by this company . They do not keep their word !	0

Bought these as a cheap and cheerful pair of flip flops to finish of a costume , not expecting them to last any length of time , but was unprepared for them not even lasting the night ! To be fair they did last till the end of the event for which I bought them , but as I was walking out the door the toe divider came out and that was that . There is no real way to repair these and frankly I would n't even bother , they would n't be worth the time taken to repair .They lasted all of 56hours of light walking / standing , other than the fact that the toe divider has come out , you would n't even think they 'd been worn .I should say it was a waste of money but in truth I only bought them for that event , and while I did hope to be able to use them afterward , it was n't really a big deal . So I guess if you need something cheap for a one time use , then these are for you , if you want something to last , even for a summer vacation or trips to the beach do n't bother , I guarantee they wo n't last .	0

I purchased a droid razr to replace the brain dead phone I was using . The Razr is a superb phone and the HD Dock adds tremendous versatility to the phone . I am currently using a bluetooth keyboard with mouse connected to my 23 inch monitor . It is more like a desktop computer . The only issue is the instructions . Unless connected to a monitor , most of the dock options do not show up . The documentation does not tell you this . The other limitation is customization . There is a limited ability to change default options on the icons that appear when in the office setting . I would like to be able to reset all of them . It only allows one to reset 4 of 6 icons . Otherwise it is an outstanding product .	1

I should have listened to the bad reviews here and not the good ones . This case covers the volume rocker with the idea that you can press on the case and it presses on the volume rocker . It does not work . You have to press VERY hard to get any sort of response and even then , it does n't always work . This is a defective product in my book . It 's too bad because the rest of the case is really nice . Do n't be fooled do n't buy it .	0
Got this for my eight year old and she loves the way the fit and look , she even has worn them while not in school . The fabric is sturdy , richly navy and soft . Do nt think these would shrink in the wash . The pants also have the stretchy elastic in the waist so that it can be adjusted to fit .	1

Like another male reviewer , I tried this product with the help of my wife on my upper cheeks in an effort to avoid having to shave that area with a razor . In my case , it did not remove any of the hair . I followed the instructions precisely and did it twice . It is possible that my hair is simply too coarse for this product , unlike hair found on women so that should be taken into consideration when considering this product . On a side note , the applicator is well designed and the product does not have the typical smell I expected . I ended up usingSally Hansen Eyebrow , Face Lip Wax , Microwaveableat the suggestion of my wife . This product worked better , but not conclusively compared toVeet High Precision Warm Facial Wax , 0 .5 Ounce .We did try the product on my younger daughter and it worked pretty well on fine hair . She was also able to do it herself and there was no inflamed area we sometimes have to deal with .	0

Our car has only one DC 12volt power source , so when my wife and I are on a road trip together , we can only recharge one of our cellphones at a time using the car chargers that came from the cellphone store . But with the iFlash dual port car charger , we can recharge both cellphones simultaneously , which is a huge benefit , since we use both phones continuously while we 're driving phone calls , GPS navigation , music , etc . . The iFlash provides up to 2 .4 Amps to each of the two ports , which is sufficient power for any mobile device currently sold in the US . Note that the iFlash car charger does not include USB cables you 'll need to use your own cables with the proper plugs .I tested the charger on a twohour drive , with my Android phone connected to one port , and my wife 's iPhone 4 connected to the other . I also hooked up my Amazon Kindle Fire HD 734 tablet for a while . Each device was being recharged at a steady rate , and there was no overheating of either the iFlash or the device we were charging .In appearance , the iFlash car charger is a compact , nice looking piece of equipment with a very solid feel . I can recommend the charger to anyone who needs to recharge their mobile devices while driving .A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes .	1

I made an online inquiry over the past weekend about a preowned vehicle . I received a call at 748pm the following business day and consider it a bit rude to call that late even with the 1hr time difference , but not a deal breaker . We spoke a bit more about the vehicle of interest and I mentioned that I have a vehicle that I am interested in trading and wanted a rough estimate and offered to provide VIN and photos if needed . Vehicle is a 2005 Lexus LS430 with 194k miles . Obviously the mileage is high , but these cars routinely go 250k300k miles , have a cult following , and KBB trade in value of around 4 , 300 . Mine is in pristine condition so I was hoping I could get closer to 5k . Salesman proceeds to tell me we took in a Volkswagen last week with over 150k miles and gave the guy 1k on trade . So yeah , you 'd be looking at about 1 , 000 on trade . I am supposed to trade it in based on what you gave someone else for a Volkswagen ? Better yet , I should disregard the KBB trade value and let you have it for 3 , 500 less than fair market ? I see this dealer has mostly positive reviews , so maybe I am the exception . But that 's where the conversation ended and I was actually more interested in an E550 that I never got the chance to inquire .

I went in last night about a 35 minute drive to look at either a M240i , 440i , or M4 . After speaking to Will I believe that was his name , I determined that I wanted to first take a look at the M240i . He proceeded to suggest that I could not afford the car and wanted me to do a credit check aka a hard inquiry on my credit before he 'd let me test drive the vehicle . He alleged that this was dealership policy . What kind of policy is that ? Who in their right mind would agree to a credit check before even having a chance to look at the vehicle and take it for a test drive ? Obviously , I am looking at other vehicles , too , and I was not going to be purchasing a BMW that same day . I also noticed that as soon as I got to the dealership , no one appeared to be interested in assisting me . Is that because I look young ? I have owned a BMW M5 and M3 , as well as the Lexus RC F . I can easily afford the M240i , which is less money . I walked out the door and went to the Chevrolet dealership , where I test drove a Corvette . I still am interested in the M240i , but BMW of Towson obviously did not want my business . Go to a different dealership !	0

This is a good case for my Galaxy S3 . It 's by no means the best case on the marker , but it 's a lot better than some of the others . Previously , I 've used this one Cell Phone Case Cover Skin for Samsung I9300 Galaxy S3 ATT , TMobile , Sprint , Verizon Purple / Silver Vines . I have to say that it provided more coverage on the phone but felt a lot less sturdier than this one from Belkin .The Belkin case has a nice grip and does n't make your phone feel bulky , which was my main problem with using a case for the Galaxy . Using the bulky case made my Galaxy S3 feel like an iPhone 4S . However , the Belkin case provides less coverage , with no coverage of the screen , and the corners , which is critical in the case of a fall . Full disclosure i did n't have the heart to drop my gorgeous new phone to test if the case would prevent damage from the bumps and drops , but although it feels sturdy , it also feels like it would n't fair entire well in a side impact .The case has enough slots for the buttons and the charge which I know is a big complaint about a lot of the cases . The case also is very snug and I have yet for it to fall off I 've been using it for three weeks .Overall a good case that provides a better grip for a phone that 's quite slippery .EDIT My phone fell with this case on it . The case flew one way , the phone flew another one . The screen on the phone shattered . Heartbreaking .	0

Every person that you encounter at the Burdick BMW dealership is a true professional dedicated to their clientele . I would highly recommend buying a car from the outstanding client advisors to getting your car serviced by their skilled mechanics .	1
I would give this place 0 stars but ca nt leave a review unless i give it a star . Everytime i take my car in there for service like oil changes they are quick and call you when they are done . But you leave it there for repairs that are covered under warranty they will not call you unless you call them and it happens repeatedly . And you better hope you do nt need a loaner cause that service sucks to ca nt believe i pay extra monthly for the service maintenance package i would , rather pay someone else to do my oil changes even though i m still paying monthly and If you leave a voicemail on the service writer machine they still do nt call you back . Do nt know how many voicemails i have left and still no response in a weeks time . I m usually very patient with automotive shops being i have worked all sides of it . I m a very patient person and relaxed person but this place has finally pissed me off . I will be going up there to get my car whether its repaired or not and finding a new dealership to go to . I hope this damn place gets bought out by people who really care about customer service .	0

The idea here is that for a single cable you can charge either Apple Lightning device or a micro USB . The lightning adapter connects to the end of a micro USB cord and is tethered to it so it does n't get lost by a rubber connector . It 's a simple idea , well executed and it works .I have been using this daily to charge my iPhone and iPad as well as a bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth headset . It is great not needing to bring two cables .Also , I must comment on the Lightning Connector It works . I have historically had dismal experience with nonApple charging cables not working after a week or so the iPhone reports that it is n't an authorized cable . I have NOT had any of those problems at all with this Belkin adaptor . Instead , I think that it might be even more secure than the authentic Apple charger because the Belkin does n't bend as easily as the Apple one .I will likely be purchasing more of these at only 5 more than the authentic Apple charger , I think that it is a bit expensive , but not overly so , especially considering that the added convenience of having two chargers in one .	1

My experience with Kia started off positive with my first lease . It recently was expired and I decided to release a new Kia Optima due to the past excellent experience and service . However , this time was different . When we were talking about prices the person who helped me was quick to negotiate but the starting price was outrageously high . Then once we got that all situated I had to wait over 3 hours for my paper work to come in and for the guy to come back and tell us what was going on . After that , I took the car home and noticed that they had sold me a car that had hail damage . I decided to call and let them know so that I would nt be charged for this later and to see if they d fix it , which they did willingly . They gave me a loaner car to drive in the meantime . When I received the car the dashboard said that the back left tire was low on air . I decided to take it upon myself and fill the tire up so that I would nt have to do it in the morning before work . The next morning the tire was completely flat . I went and filled it up again and it seemed fine but it was still slowly losing air . I called Kia services about this issue because I had to take one of my girls to a friends house in the afternoon and the loaner car was not able to be driven or safe for the girls . When I got ahold of Kia services they told me once the rental is in your hands it is your responsibility after I had explained that the tire was already low when they gave it to me . Also , this car was not a rental its a loaner . So , I told them this and tried to get them to send road side services to help fix it before the play date but this was not happening . I proceeded to call Gazi the sales rep about the issue but it was his day off and he did nt want anything to do with it and that I was on my own real nice , right ? . After a few back and forth phone calls and after they hung up on me and proceeded to send me straight to voicemail , they offered to tow the car and fix it but they did nt know how long that d be which would leave me and the girls stranded . Long story short I made it to the dealership to pick up my original hail damaged car and when I was about to leave they charged me 10 for gas in the loaner car when I barely drove it which was about 3 worth of gas . This was terrible customer service and its awful that they still OVER CHARGED FOR GAS after giving me a loaner car with a flat tire .	0

This product does NOT work at all ! It 's supposed to require only one drop but it does n't work even after squeezing half the bottle in the toilet . There is NO pleasant odor and it does not prevent toilet odors from escaping into the air . This was a total disappointment and a waste of money . I only tried it because it was cheaper than Poo Pourri but I 'd rather spend the extra money for a quality product that actually works as advertised because this one definitely does NOT work .I wrote this review to save others from wasting their money and to prevent someone else from being frustrated .	0

I used the gel as directed on the pack and after about 10minutes he told me the pain had gone .However , by the next day the pain had come back , though he said it was not as intense as before .

I have been searching for a mop to clean my laminate floors for years and finally I found one that is easy to use , easy to store and cleans with water no chemicals needed . In addition to the wet mop I purchased the duster mop pad and it does a great job too .The mop is easy to use and store . The pads are good quality . Ecloth has become my favorite cleaning cloth ever . In fact , it is all I use now . I really like that all I need is water . Yea sure , sometimes I can and do use cleaners , but it is really not necessary to get a clean floor or surface . I have and will continue to recommend this ecloth to friends and family .	1

This is VERY nice . High quality and the scent is VERY accurate . I use it unscented liquid soaps . For anyone whose ever tried to find a truly unscented soap , you know what it can be like . They are NEVER completely unscented . I recently got rather pungent 34unscented34 castile soap . This was the ONLY fragrance oil that could blend well with it . I 'm happy to say that it now smells like I 'm sitting in a pile of roses . It saved me having to throw out a rather costly bottle of soap .

For this to be such a high end case I was HIGHLY disappointed at the quality of this screen protector . It was awful and trapped dirt and made the screen look pixilated and grainy . The case gets dirty looking from going in and out of your pocket . and the belt clip is big hard to get it to stay on to you and hard to take the phone out of it with one hand . I would n't think that after paying 35 dollars for a case I would be buying another one less than a month later . BUT here I am needed a case with a higher quality screen protector . I guess I should have gone with a Ballistics case and maybe I would get better quality	0

This case is excellent . It seems like an often experience these days when I find that yet another cell phone accessory has a ridiculous margin . . . This case is a prime example of why I know that . This case is selling on Amazon for less than 9 .00 . . . Now , the case is better than an otterbox or lifeproof case , in my opinion . Why would I say such a thing ? Because both lifeproof and otterboxes , for 60100 dollars , offer the same offering almost , with the exception being the screen protector . Well , the screen protector is a sham . That 's right , an outright sham . You rarely see a scratched up iphone or ipad screen . The reason for that is modern cell phones and tablets are made with gorilla glass , which will shatter way before it will actually scratch . A screen protector is n't going to stop your screen from shattering when you drop it flat on its ' face . . .what will stop it is a 1 / 3234 bezel protruding from the front of the screen so that it ca n't touch the ground . . .which is exactly what this case does . If you drop it in the street and it hits a rock , you might be in trouble . . .but I do nt ' think the screen protectors will save you much more from it .PROSCheap , easy to grip , and easy to get on , once you know how to do it .CONSThe power cord cover , and the headphone jack covers are both hard to open . The case is n't easy to get on before you really understand how to do it . . .here 's how to do it Put the bottom part in , and then put in the side with the volume buttons . .otherwise you 'll be fighting with the rubber to get them over the volume buttons forever .BOTTOM LINE9 .00 for a 60 dollar case . . .lovin it .	1

I moved to the Houston area from Detroit Michigan with my well maintained 2009 DTS with well documented maintenance records from lafantaine cadillac in Brighton Michigan . Again I purchased this Cadillac brand new . While driving from Detroit to my new home in the Houston area a message appeared across the dashboard which read SERVICE LANE DEPARTURE so on May 3 , 2014 while driving through Houston I noticed the Sewell Cadillac sign so I immediately exited the Katy freeway and pull into the service department . After having the issue of the lane departure diagnosed by the Sewell technicn I was told that the module went out and needed replacement the cost to me was 696 . 71Even though that was steep but for a beautiful Cadillac that was BABIED since new well it was money well spent and I would n't have to worry about that for some time to come , but to my dismay almost 8 months later January 2015 I experienced the same message telling me to service my lane departure system . Right then I called Sewell Cadillac where they fixed the problem on May 3 , 2014 and explained that there 's problem with lane departure system and that they serviced the 8 months earlier and could they repair or replace the module . Well later that day I brought the car in and explained the issue to the technicn and to my dismay told me that it would cost me another 696 or so dollars to fix the problem again . I advised him politely and he refused to replace the module even though the repair was still under warranty . That was the ABSOLUTE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER at a Cadillac dealership . With that I say to all STAY AWAY FROM SEWELL CADILLAC ! ! IF I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS I WOULD ! Ricardo Rudolph	0

Went in for a recall and they completely messed up my passenger door . Went in again to get it fixed and they tried to avoid blame , then just hammered it back in so the door closes correctly and did n't fix anything . . . paint is still chipped and dings in the side where they hammered it back in .

I bought this fish oil because most of the reviews were positive but it did not turn out to be the case . It tasted pretty bad to me from the first opening of the bottle out of the box it was n't cold . . . it was room temperature . After first opening , it has always been kept in the fridge . Since my daughters , 6 and 11 years old , love fish oil , I let them try . They used to chew fish oil capsules instead of swallowing them so I assume they know the taste of the fish oil more than I do . My 6year old told me it is gross and my 11year old told me it has a strange after taste and she does not want it anymore .As for me I have to force myself every time to take a spoonful of the fish oil . Another strange thing is that it made me fuzzy and sleepy after taking it . . . . I hesitate to finish the bottle . . . I 'm not sure if I have the spoiled fish oil or the quality issue . I will look for a different brand .The company sold me the fish oil has a great customer service . They asked me to return the product to one of their local store and got my full refund .Update As of 10 / 17 / 2011 I do not buy liquid fish oil over mail order anymore especially Summer . The one I got via Amazon must be spoiled . I purchased it via a local health / grocery store and tasted fantastic and fresh . It is more expensive retail value plus tax but it is worthy .	0

New car purchaseI had an appointment to meet John Combs at the showroom , he met me when I pulled up and was easy to talk to and very knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in . He showed me several different trim levels of the vehicle and explained every option in detail which made it easy to make an informed decision . Everyone in the dealership was very friendly and polite . This is my second vehicle purchased from Galeana . If you are considering purchasing a vehicle stop in and talk to them !	1

West Palm Beach Location West Palm Beach Broward Motor Sports they say no tactics just savings it 's actually NO SAVINGS ALL TACTICS ! Javier seemed like a nice professional guy . . . til we got there ! As promised we 'd leave a review , some good , some bad ALL TRUE ! Looking for a Birthday present for my hubby and really wanted him to be excited about the experience so I did all the prelim work and details before I got there to make it easy and fun for him . . . so I thoughtSo disappointing ! After speaking with Javier at the West Palm Motors Sports on Friday and telling him my range and absolute highest price that I was paying cash for a slingshot he said no problem come in and we 'll work it out . He said they needed to move the 2017s and that he 'd have everything ready since I said we could do all of the paperwork and have it ready in an hour . So Friday I told him we were only interested in the black and the silver slingshot and we 'd be there Saturday morning and I called when I was 1 / 2 away so he could be ready for us we got there and now the car had been turned into the demo , great extra discount right ? ! He said yes . . . Until the paperwork and then no extra discount ! We looked at the black one , then asked to see the silver which on the website was picture perfect , but Then he did n't know where the silver one was ! He and another guy had to go find it . . Another 15 minutes they found it after literally running up and down the street at their service centre off premises then it was n't even completely assembled ! OK so let 's take the black one for a test drive and they could n't find the keys for over 45 minutes ! Leaving us in the heat and did n't even offer us water , kept saying it will only be a minute . So much for being prepared for us . Then we sat down , and the tactics began he told me he could n't do anywhere near 23k I said then why am I here ? I drove 45 minutes because I told you my range in cash and you said we could make it work and then upon arrival the black one we wanted was then deemed a demo . . . Supposed to be even more of a discount but nope ! All the jokes and do n't worry we 'll take care of it went out the door and so did we ! Very frustrated I wasted my time in trying to be loyal to this salesman and the manager did n't even bother coming out with their last and final that was above the budget I had originally said and without all the extras Javier promised . All in all typical sales , lies and frustrating experience ! Update Upon receiving the managers email about my visit and experience I emailed back I just got a response . . . but not from the manager . . . from the same sales rep that caused all this to being with ! lol annnnnd for the record . . . we ended up less than 500 apart after I came from the budget he said he could work within and without the extras he promised !	0
how can there are reviews for a movie that was n't out in theaters yet ? i am referring to inequality for all . i do believe movie owners do n't want to show this movie because it is anti big corporations in politics ! could that be the reason fandango has negative reviews for a movie that was n't out yet ?	0

My Spring allergies have just mildly started . I 've been using this medicine per the recommend dosing Adult Dose 3 pump sprays , 3 times per day and have good results ! I like the fact this natural allergy spray leaves me free from drowsiness and that 's it 's free from alcohol , dairy , glutens , sugar or yeast . The taste I imagined would be undesirable but it really is virtually free from taste and it 's purely water based . It also can be used by children ages two years old and up as well .I've had zero negative effects and have gone about my day like I normally would . I think I 'll be keeping this on hand year round ! It really works ! No more congestion , runny nose , or itchy eyes for me . It 's great if you are looking for a more natural way to handle those allergies and fabulous if you have issues and need to avoid things like gluten , etc . . .	1
I bought the Hyperion 4200 extended battery for my Galaxy S3 . I 'm a huge phone geek , and let me tell you , it 's worth the money . My battery life is insane now . I can go 2 days on one charge with medium use . That being said , there really are n't many options for cases with the extended battery . I got this case , and it 's mediocre at best . Here 's a breakdown of the pro 's and con 's .Pro 's .Well , it is one of the only cases available that will fit the extended battery .It 's white , and looks somewhat decent on the phoneDoesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone .Easy to get on and off the phoneCon'sIt 's so hard to press the power and volume buttons it 's insane . There are no indentions on the case , so you have to physically look to see if you are pressing in the right area .It has started to peel up my screen protector from the sides where the power button isIt really does n't offer much protection since it 's so thin .I've read about a Qcell case that will work with the hyperion battery , but it 's no longer available on amazon or anywhere for that matter .I really got sick of how hard it was to push the power and volume buttons , so I used a razor blade and cut out around both the volume and power buttons . I used some small precise scissors and trimmed it just a little bigger than the buttons . The result , a lot easier to find and push the buttons now . Looks kind of crappy , but what other options do we have . Again , not much to pick from , but it will get the job done .EDITI went ahead and bought the Qcell case , and let me tell you , it 's hands down better than the hyperion case . It fits better for one thing . The mic hole did n't really line up on the hyperion . This one is perfect . All holes are even bigger to help the charger fit in the bottom better . It feels better , it does n't push my screen protector off when pushing the power button , and just feels nicer . Oh , the power and volume buttons on the qcell case are so much easier to press , and you do n't have to cut them out like the hyperion case . Save yourself a headache and just get the qcell one . Well worth it .	0

I was left speechless by the level of care everyone had at Larry H . Miller Toyota . Justin reached out to us and helped us with our search and gave us hope of obtaining our vehicle since we have been trying almost everywhere He asked us to go in for us to make a plan so we spoke to Andrew . Andrew gave us all the information needed about getting our approval and got us approved for our car . At this point we had a sense of relief because we have finally ended our search and can finally somewhat relax . Afterwards we had to talk to Richard and get our paperwork set and ready to go . Richard gave us more certainty that we have successfully purchased our car . Even though I was a nervous wreck I 've never had such a great customer service and I recommend LHM to anyone because of their extreme customer care service Thank you a billion guys for all your help ! ! !	1
Of course everyone is different . But this item IMO is useless . Keeps you awake , if anything . It does nothing to mask or 34condition34 existing noise , and is n't soothing of itself .

I never imagined myself getting a sportsstyle nursing bra as I have never found sports bras , on their own , to be particularly supportive for me . Without any special gadgets I could spot , I did n't understand how such a style of nursing bra would do well for me . However , this one had so many positive reviews and I had heard such good things about the company . . .This bra is far better than I expected . Yes , it 's a sports bra but I was amazed at just how supportive and shapely it is . I am completely comfortable in this bra thanks to the lack of underwire as well as the incredible support , whether it be day or night . The clasps are easy to work as well without too much fiddling .	1

On package was asked to leave a 5 star rating with good feedback . What do I get out of it ? It 's not a screen protector that fits my phone nor is it one that is clear . The screen protector is way to long for the Htc Thunderbolt . I thought it was advertised for the Thunderbolt , must be another Thunderbolt somewhere with a really long screen . it 's not the model I have by HTC . Even if it did fit lets face it who wants to look at a rainbow effect screen protector all day ? I want clear . The 6400 screen protector is clear and fits , but this one not the case .	0

This shoe has the style of a mary jane with roomy fit , and the comfort of going barefoot . I like the velcro strap that is wide enough to feel comfortable , and not cut into my foot . There was enough room in the shoe to comfortably wear a slim sock , which felt best to me . The shoe is lightweight , which is a plus . The support was sufficient . I have not worn them all day , but did not have any discomfort for the time that I wore them . There was no breaking in period . Just put them on , and went ! Very pleased !	1
I do n't like taking pills , but I love getting exercise . Sometimes maybe too much exercise . . . like 20 mile hikes and running half marathons . This stuff keeps me from having to take a pill for the aches that happen afterwards . I rarely have to apply it twice just one application is enough to recover from even a 13 mile run and still be able to move fairly normally the next day . I also use it to relieve shoulder pain from too much computer work .If you are headed out to go backpacking , take this it is worth every gram of weight in your pack .	1
Too good to be true of course . I 'm not totally disappointed because it was only 3 / 4 dollars . I was excited to see that it lit up when I plugged it in . Worked fine for a whole week . Then boom , out of the blue , no juice . The red light was still on so it looked like it was working but the phone would n't charge . I tried multiple cords to see if that was the problem . Alas , the little green plug is dead an in the garbage . I 'm buying a different brand / kind today . Hopefully , it will last for at least a month . 0 Do n't buy it .	0

I took my 2014 elantra to check the a / c cause it was nt getting power to the a / c fuse , i had it checked before and my compressor and a / c panel was working fine , the dealer started guessing without succes for over a week and changing parts . After that , they found a ground wire that cost 30 dollars and charge me over 800 . 00 in labor very incompetent techs , and the service manager said they were trying things that work 9 times out of 10 guessing game . That he stated that they should have charged me more . Very disappointed and i would recomend if you have a problem like that find a certified tech and do nt bring it to this stealership .	0

This is my full review . I did nt finish it the day . The dealership is well organized . I would give at least 45 stars to the sales team . However , I let down by the finance team by a well 3 hours waiting to complete the transaction , with terrible attitudes . Please note that this is a business purchase with cheque / credit card , no financing involved . I describe my experience as followsAfter test drive and negotiation , I shaked hands with the sales Mr . Sam at 210 PM and then I expected to complete the payment process with a finance manager . I waited for about 30 mins , Naza introduced herself to handle my transaction . When she realised that it was a business purchase , she was not sure about the documents requirement , so she asked me to wait . I waited for 1 hour , in between the sales team checked with me whether I need any help . When I told them I had waited for a hour , they brought me to the finance director . The FD told me that a director resolution from my HQ overseas was required . My opinion 1st Naza did not feedback to me her boss comments 2nd it is not common for a corporation to specially pass a resolution to approve a purchase of a Hyundai . Anyway , within 10 mins I worked out with the FD for a solution , i . e . emailed him immediately a copy of Directors resolution for bank signatory bearing my name . then I thought the process will be completed soon , I was wrong . There was another waiting of about 1 hour , it was about 445 , casher was closed already When Naza waved to me , I told her it was a long wait . She said she has other customers to take care not sure it is common she could jump to another customer before she was done with me . Upon completion of the document at about 505 PM , I asked her any document the person needed for collection of the car one of our colleague will come to collect the car instead myself on Monday , she was not sure , so asked me to check with Sales . I checked with Sales , they do nt need anything if Finance approved to release the car . So I went back to the FD with Sam , in front of a group , the FD spoke out loud a bankers check will do , that s all I need ! I drove away at 510 , 10 mins later , Naza called me and instructed me that the person who collect the car must provide some personal document . I told her ask her FD to call me since he told me differently . Naza said I made the thing difficult and she can override the FDIt is my impression , that the financial team the FD FM is big headed themselves and lacking the knowledge of the procedures , as confused in1 what document needs for business purchase , 2 whether company cheque acceptable or must be bankers check , 3 with no knowledge of company auto policy coverage etc . it is blanket coverage for all employees for business car travelSo I kept obtained different instructions between the FD and the FM . personal opinion , the Finance team should attend internal process procedure training and customer services training , that 's the only way to further improve the dealership . I am pity the sales that they went through the hard negotiation with customers and all ruined by the poor service from finance staff . Further update today , 17 July'17 , my colleague complaint the bad attitudes from Naza again during car collection , she even requested my signature must be showed on the banker 's cheque . Suggest her to google what is banker 's cheque , or attend a financial course / training . I would not recommend this dealership to any business purchase .	0

Never going backWent here to try and trade in my almost 3 year old Mini that I bought brand new from Mini Momentum . The car 's retail value is around 21k and trade in value around 1718k . They offered me 13k so I walked out . Went to Mercedes of Greenway and got 17 . 7 for my trade in , a low rate and a better car . Thought they would be the same as Mini , but they 're not . If you have to go here ask for Lee Carter . I did n't know he was working here or I would have asked for him . He used to be at Mini and was why I had a great experience there . Be warned this dealership 's management will probably extremely low ball your trade in . I suggest you get it valued online by Auto Nation first and come armed with that info if you must come here .	0

This is a nice and compact USB charger that outputs 1000 mA current good for most devices except iPad / iPad2 / Amazon Kindle Fire .Its thin form factor means it wo n't block any adjacent power outlets when it is plugged into the wall or an extension power strip .Since the price difference between one with a micro USB cable and without is only 61 cents , I would suggest getting one with the cable .If you need an extra iPad charger 2100 mA output current , I would recommend AmazonBasicsAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet 2 .1 Amp Output .	1

Let me start by saying that I have very sensitive teeth . I have mostly used manual toothbrushes probably for most of my 45 years . I had purchased a Crest Spinbrush probably a few years ago , and finally started using it in the last year . It cleaned my teeth well enough and did n't bother me . This OralB Pulsonic is very sleek and appears to be well made . Unfortunately , even on the sensitive setting , it hurt on impact , and I 'm not talking a little , I mean alot .

I have several teeth issues all at once . I read up on possibly using Superglue and my other option was this . I 'm afraid to try Superglue even after extensive reading . So , I got this DenTek stuff . It was only 3 at Walmart by the way . Well , it 's like caulking . It comes in a super tiny vial and looks like a long eraser . You pull off a small hunk and apply it to your tooth . Check out their website for good instructions . Well , after hours and hours , it just chips away . It just does n't dry completely , ever . I ca n't imagine how ANYONE could chew on food after using this stuff . I suppose , if you had a very particular issue that semihardened caulklike putty would help you , then give it a shot . The only help it gave me was very temporary filling to keep food from getting into a dropped a filling cavity in my tooth . No way I can chew on it ! ! Sheri Gill Writer , Mom , Mage !	0

After two terrible service experiences at Niello Audi , I do n't recommend this dealer to anyone who cares about quality and customer service . The service reps , especially David Hallin , are more concerned about closing out paperwork than in explaining to customers what repairs were made and what procedures to follow to avoid future problems . This was the case with our air conditioner which has n't operated correctly since we purchased our Audi . I am changing my service provider to Audi Rocklin . Update as of 2 September 2017Wow , what a fantastic customer experience at Audi Rocklin versus my totally unsatisfactory experience at Niello Audi ! ! ! Where Niello Audi said there was nothing wrong with my air conditioner and to just read the Owner 's Manual like I was stupid ! , Rocklin Audi found that the freon level was only half of what it should have been . No wonder the air conditioner did n't work properly ! Rocklin Audi added the freon and checked out the complete system , including adding dye to identify any minute leaks . The Service Tech Mike at Rocklin Audi took the time to explain exactly what the mechanics were doing and why . He treated me , the customer , with sincere caring respect . The immense pride and focus on the customer at Rocklin Audi were highly evident . In contrast , I almost had to beg for time at Niello Audi . I am so glad to have found a dealer who cares about the customer not just at the time of sale , but throughout the ownership lifecycle of the vehicle . Niello Audi lost me as a customer and I definitely wo n't go there to buy the A8 I 've been looking at . Rocklin Audi has my business now and I recommend it to other customers who wish to receive a positive experience . Rocklin Audi understands that the Customer Comes First !	0

i just had one of the worst online purchase experiences in 30 15 years . i tried to redeem a trialpay ticket and had nothing but trouble . i finaly backed out of the purchase sequence in the hope that my credit card would not be charged as i received no place to print a ticket . the pages for trialpay were no in html format but in ascii plain text . there were no buttons shown for navigation . if you are interested i have a select all copy of the page i could send if you wanted it . in any case i do not plan to ever attempt to use any trialpay programs in the future .	0

When I developed rectal incontinence , I used these wipes exclusively , then after a few months , the rectal areas were red , itching and burning like a bee sting . My doctors assumed it was caused by hemorrhoids , so I had several surgeries to remove the hemorrhoids . I continued to use the Cottonelle wet wipes , and found that I still had red , itching and burning skin all the time , it was so painful , it was hard to walk . My doctors told me that irritation was caused a fissure , and I needed surgery again . After the surgery healed , I went through several other medical tests and treatment to resolve the horrible skin problems and no matter what I tried nothing resolved it . Finally , after six years of fighting this problem , which literally disabled me from working outside my home , one specialist asked me what did I use to clean the area . When I told about the Cottonelle wipes , she immediately told me to stop using them and use the Balneol cream . Three weeks after I stopped using the Cottonelle wipes and started using on Balneol all the rectal inflammation stopped . These wipes are a wet wipe horror , the chemicals in them stay on top of the skin and begin to erode the top layers of skin , which opens the skin to all the germs coming from the fecal material . Nothing will resolve the inflammation except to discontinue using them around the anal and vaginal areas . So if you have sensitive skin , then do n't buy these wipes ever .	0

I really love that these tests are so sensitive , and yet so affordable in comparison to First Response . The only con to these tests are if you look too close , like holding them up to a light or a sunny window , you can see an 34evap34 line . It is the test strip with moisture on it , which can sometimes look like an early BFP positive test .	1

You have better chance of getting better vehicle service work if you bought a BMW from CarMax than bringing your BMW here for ANYTHING service work related . Service director David Dovenbarger flatly refused to honor BMW 's warranty on my vehicle because it was purchased from another BMW dealer . To make matters worse he and I reviewed the issues my vehicle was having for over 30 minutes Monday morning and he never mentioned he could not service my vehicle . Instead , this clown took my keys and stated he would call me with any updates . Even worse this simple minded individual thought he would be cute and wait almost 48 hours to return multiple calls left for him for status updates to tell me he was not comfortable working on my car because it was purchased from a different BMW dealership . During this call the service director was condescending , disrespectful and even dared me to call BMW North America on him ! Again , this man and his actions towards me and my family are a disgrace to the BMW name and the owners of this facility . Take your BMW to more reputable BMW dealership service departments in Atlanta , Huntsville or Montgomery for ANY service work . Avoid the headache and go elsewhere for any and all BMW service work needed .	0

This product has 1000 mg of oil . not necessarily fish oil . It does not cite the source of either oil . It does not say it is organic . It says it has high concentrations of EPA and DHA , but does n't say how much .Buying this product would be like buying a vitamin C tablet without knowing how much vitamin C is actually in it .Most Fish Oil products are diluted considerably with other oils , like Soybean oil , to which some people are allergic .How could anyone buy a product this expensive without any statement about its content or concentration that can be numerically evaluated ? The product could have 1 percent fish oil for all you know .	0

So I go back to try to figure out what happen . Someone else has sold me the skirt . I do n't understand , because I ordered it thru My Orders . Which should 've meant it came from the same Place . NOPE . TERRIBLE . I DON34 T UNDERSTAND . ANY WAY I threw it in the trash . That 's how bad it was . Besides , would 've cost me more time and money to send back .	0
I dropped 40 on a tube of this stuff after my neighbor commented to my wife how nice our yard is looking since purchasing our home from a guy that let everything go outside . Problem was that poison sumac was all over the place , and I did n't know what it looked like till it was too late . She said , that this stuff would clear it up overnight but it was expensive . She was right about the expensive part , sadly not the clear it up .It did help alleviate the itching for longer than the Benandryl products . It did nothing to get rid of the systemic problem , the toxins causing the rash , which is why I spent so much money on this product .I would definitely not recommend purchasing this !	0

I work on my feet in a hospital for 10 hours a day . I put all my weight I 'm not overweight on the ball of my foot , and by the end of the day , they really hurt . I bought the Skecher 's Shape Ups a year ago , and my feet stopped hurting ! They make you put the weight on the middle or arch of your foot , and they are so soft and springy . I love them . It is time for a new pair , but even after wearing them for a year , they are not worn out . The only downside is that you can not run in them . But it has never been a problem for me .	1

This product is great . The pads stick almost too well , so have some type of adhesive remover if you have sensitive skin or if you do n't like an outline on your underarm and do not budge . They absorb and are undetectable except for very short sleeve t 's . So , no cap sleeves or girly t 's with this product . I wear them mostly with sweaters as I sweat like hell in sweaters in the cold weather for some reason , and these have been a godsend . I also use odoban spray twice a week and apply it at night . I have not had any problems getting the pads to stick when I do this , just do n't use a spray or deodorant on the same day you will be applying the pads as they will not stick , even if your underarms are dry feeling . These are expensive for every day use that s the only real bummer .	1

I was looking for a nice classic leather belt that will wear well with jeans and other casual pants . I stumbled across this one , and went ahead and ordered a large I 'm a size 10 / 12 . My only regret is that I wish I had ordered a medium since I am on the second to smallest hole currently and that leaves a decent bit of extra belt hanging off . However , the belt is just about perfect .The leather has held up very well , and it does not seem as prone to bending in the back middle as some of my previous belts bonded leather have done in the past . It fits very comfortably , and keeps me from constantly tugging my jeans up , as they start to slide down my hips after I 've worn them for a bit .My preconceived notion of Carhartt was that it was a rugged brand , but this belt looks very smart with a pair of black jeans and a sweater . I love that I can transition a jeans belt to slacks and have it adapt to the outfit . It does n't draw a lot of attention , but that was n't what I was looking for in this belt . The price is only slightly more than the cheap belts that they sell in many stores , but I can tell that it is made out of leather and not the bonded crud that starts to crack and fall apart after a few wears . I will say that this belt has made me keen to try other belts from this brand and I would highly recommend this , just order a size smaller if you are on the fence of which size to go with .	1

There 's a few brands I LOVE and MegaFood is one . I 'll pay a bit more for vitamins and herbs made with integrity and in a glass bottle . Why pay for something healthy in BPA laden plastic bottles ? I just ordered these for a friend who said she 's anemic and is always tired ! I too am anemic , but you would n't know it . I add one of these to my diet daily , and love the size , taste and ease of taking this tablet . I did buy their Adrenal formula , and the pills are HUGE , but when your vitamin is made from foods . . . .you ca n't lose . The MegaFood product brand to me is truly one of the best !	1
First , if you 've been sweating in your clothes for years then start using this , you 'll likely get that 34funny34 odor you see some of the reviews referring to . It does ok on old 34embedded34 sweat , but you wo n't get the best results on clothing of this sort . It needs to be used for the life of the clothes . It works best on synthetic fabrics .Also , be sure to measure . Using more wo n't deal with the odors better . I notice that my clothes come out with that funky smell even worse when I do nt measure and use more product .For best results use for the life of the garment and measure for each use .	1

My husband was beginning to have some trouble sleeping . After reading the reviews on the Spoonk , I thought I 'd just take the plunge and spend the money on one . When I gave it to my husband I told him how so many people had found that it helped them sleep , but that it might be uncomfortable right at first . I wanted him to be prepared for a little discomfort but know the pain would n't last . Sure enough , he said after about 510 minutes he did n't even feel any pain at all , and he actually did begin sleeping better at night . I 'm hoping after he uses it faithfully , he may also have some relief from his back or knee pain .	1

I bought this razor shortly after my son was born because I 've decided to start doing things like my grandfather . In a world where men are getting facials , wearing eyeliner , and other girly things , I wanted my son to see that pampering was okay , but only if done in a manly way .On to the razor . . . I love it . It 's comfortable to hold and the weight of the razor itself does all the cutting . It is very easy to find the proper angle with this razor and is great for learning . I have n't clean shaved in about 8 years because I always got infected hairs with those disposable razors . With this razor , I have n't had a single infected hair . Plus my wife loves the feel of my smooth face .	1

i 'm really disappointed with the website , i ca n't get to my favorite theater list . every time i click on the my theaters tab on the top of the page it directs me the local movie times page which prompts me to enter a zip code . when i go onto fandango i usually just go to my favorite theater list to see what 's playing . by removing that function it just makes it too difficult to search for what i 'm looking for and not worth the effort .	0
Made an appointment two weeks in advance for two recalls melting dash and seat belt lifter to be done . Drove 90 miles in to town to stay with my in laws to have the service done . howed up at 9 am for the appointment and Patrick told me they did n't have the parts for the seat belt lifter . Wish I had been informed of that before I drove up , but no big deal because I was mainly wanting the dash to be replaced . I got a call around 130 from Patrick saying another car took longer than expected and that they were n't sure they 'd get to it today . He asked if I could pick it up Monday but I could n't really do that since my wife and I have work back home on Monday and do n't have 2 hours on a weekday to drive back out here before they close . I figured 9 am was early enough for them to get the recalls done , but apparently not . At least he was polite about it . Guess I 'll have to drive back out here another weekend . Patrick told me I 'd get priority next time so I 'll update my rating if that happens .	0

My niece is a doctor specializing in nutrition . When I showed her my latest blood test results , she noted that my homocysteine level was more than twice the normal level . She recommended this , which is activated folate , to get the folate to move through to all the necessary places in the body . She also recommended taking B12 sublingually to assist the process , plus to aid in energy level , which is reduced because of the folate issue . The proof is in the pudding my blood tests six months later showed a reduction of homocysteine from 26 to 12 ! The recommended level is 10 .4 , according to what was printed on the results , and she said 8 is an optimum level . So I will definitely be taking this from now on , and this was the brand she recommended .	1

When i first saw this jacket i wanted to buy it but only xl size was available . after reading the reviews i realized it d be small for me . i needed xxl . soon after that item was out of stock . i was surprised after couple days when i saw that there is one xxl size available . i ordered it at same moment . later i realized that probably somebody returned the jacket , because when i tried to wear it left sleeve was sewn so it was impossible to slide my hand through the sleeve . at the moment i am located in afghanistan so its impossible for me to return the item so i can say that i wasted my money on buying this jacket . item came wrapped in plastic and without tags . amazon should check the items that were previously returned because there must be reason why somebody returned it .	0
Got this for my wife to replace a Coach case no protection This was sleek enough for her , gave access to all the buttons which was a must and is a nice 2 tone pink . 2 materials are used , the middle big portion is aluminum and the top and bottom are polycarbonate . Feels nice and light too !	1

This is just what it says it is . It 's a basic white silicone case for the iPhone 4 . It arrived in basic Amazon packaging , not the blister pack mess . I had no trouble fitting it on the iPhone and it 's got a good fit . I have been using this for about one month and although it has not stretched , I suspect that it might in time . I will update this review if that does happen . Regardless , the only other possible flaw is that the silicone seems to stick to my pocket when I 'm trying to put it in my jeans pocket . It 's a minor gripe for an overall solid case .	1

absolutely detest what you have done with the fandango website . it used to be so easy to navigate and provided lots of great information . this new site is cumbersome and visually dull !	0
fandango website communicated to me that there was an error in my ticket purchase transaction and that it could not be completed , causing me to repeatedly attempt to correct complete the transaction . unknown to me , fandango actually charged multiple purchases to my credit card from each of these follow up transactions , all done with un notified communications purposefully aimed at delivery to my spam inbox from fandango .	0

EDIT ! ! Turns out i got a fake ! ! All the pics posted match what went wrong with my case . . . I am upset ! ! i want to give NEGATIVE stars ! ! I purchased this item at the end of last year . . . it has been on my phone for about 2 .5 monthsdaily use since and the rubber is simply falling apart . I am not happy with the quality at all ! ! I do not abuse my phone or case in any way and i an very sad to have to replace this case so soon . If i rub my thumb down he rubber side , small bits of rubber rub right off . I expected much more from such a big Name . . .FYI ONLY FITS OEM SHAPED CHARGERS I had to trim all my chargers down to fit but it was worth it in the beginning because i loved the case .FYI2 Headphone jack pretty Small ! ! Great Short term solution . For the right price i would keep buying them and considering them disposable . LOOOOVED the look of the case when i first got it that s why it got 2 stars , because it was pretty ! lol now it looks battered .	0
i sent a message to your regarding the lack of popcorn salt . and was told that your company wanted to sell the salt to the customers who bought their tickets to see the movie , not only to a buy drinks and purchased popcorn , but when asked for salt , they gave me kitchen salt and when i complained they told me that your cinimas wanted me to purchase the containers of butter salt , now that was going a lttle to far , so my friends and i go to another movie house , where they care about people	0

I purchased 12 new vehicles from Moses Ford since 1994 and still own four of them 2007 Ford Expedition EL , 2015 Ford F150 Lariat , 2015 Ford Escape Titanium , 2016 Ford Fusion My oldest son . At 29 , 000 miles and still under manufacture 's warrant I took my 2015 Escape in for brake problem . They claimed the brake failure was due to lack of oil changes and wanted 9600 to replace the engine . Long story short , they caused my warranty to be void because another Ford dealer could n't fix the problem because Moses filed a false claim . I had the issue repaired by former Ford mechanic that has his own shop for 704 . Today he showed me the part that failed vacuum pump and it was obvious the part failed and not the engine . The part was bolted to the cam shaft and the bolt broke off in the cam shaft . He drilled it out with special tool and the engine is fine . No metal shavings in the engine and was NEVER out of oil . Moses ' mechanic falsified the record and indicated the engine had no oil and that it was full of metal shavings . My engine is fine . Why would a mechanic not fix a vehicle that was covered by manufacture 's warranty ? He implied I could bring in oil change receipts and it would be covered . I refused to falsify receipts yet now have no warranty due to Moses ' false record . I did attempt to contact the owner of Moses Ford , but have not been successful . Moses has great deals on Ford vehicles and top notch sales people , but the service department could stand to have a few classes in customer service . I will be buying Ford vehicles in the future , but Moses is no longer on my list I have two closer dealerships to choose from Turnpike Bert Wolfe , but will most likely be driving to Colonial Ford .	0

This shoe was Extremely small I 'm a regular size eight however , this shoes felt a half size smaller . I bought this for a formal engagement and had my husband pull this shoes and stretched it until my feet could comfortably fit in these shoe . . .I simply could not return the shoe because it was delivered the day before the event so I was desperate and had to make it work . My feet were able to fit into the shoes but just for me to walk from my vehicle straight to my sit at the event . .I sat all thoughtout the event and could n't budge . . .I was looking fly but could n't walk around . The shoes are gorgeous but the front tips of the shoes seems to losing a lot of its glitter and revealing the material beneath not cute at all .Theses shoes are a comfortable high but the fit is terrible I would recommend ordering a 1 / 2 size bigger if you 're planning to actually walking around in these . . .what I observed is that the left side of the shoes is manufactured much smaller that the right side and this was n't an issue with my feet . . .would purchase this again but only if it were on sale too expensive for a poor fit . THE Packaging the box the shoes came in was old and damaged it looked like the shoe was in the warehouse for years it did not appear to be a newer shoe . .it appears that these shoes were sitting on a shelf for years or even months . . I 'll have to give these shoes away because I will not be able to squeeze my feet into them again . . .a waste of my money .	0
While searching for which brand of Tumeric to buy I ran across a blog written buy a guy who had cancer and was blogging about everything he was taking , how much and how often , . . .etc .

This floss is very silky and smoothe . Unfortunately , the features it is known for are what make this floss ineffective . I used this floss for 2 or 3 years thinking it made a difference , but when I tried another floss by a different brand , I just knew that Glide was not doing a thing to remove plaque ! Glide floss slips and slides over the teeth , so it is seemingly more gentle on gums , but it provides no friction against the tooth to actually dislodge and remove plaque . It just slides right over top of the plaque and leaves it there . I could never go back to using this Glide floss .If you 're wondering what brand I switched to , it'sReach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss , Fluoride , 50Yard Dispensers Pack of 6 . This floss is very gentle on gums because it is made from a soft , thread like material it can fit in small spaces too , and it actually removes plaque I can see the plaque come off onto the floss , unlike Glide . I recommend .	0

I am not certain that everyone needs a Mini Cooper S convertible . But we wanted one and had the good fortunate to afford it . That said , we headed straight for Mini of Edison where we had the good fortune to meet with sales associate , David Kach , and manager , Bill Dias . While the dealership had a brand new red convertible with black wheels just my cup of tea David and Bill sensed that I was not pleased to with the smaller 16 inch wheels . Instead , they put together a terrific offer on a thunder gray convertible 4100 mile demo with bigger wheels and a long list of options at a super price . It was clear from the outset that the team wanted us to have the vehicle we wanted not merely one they wanted to sell . The price was right the car has a great set of options including a JCW interior and so the deal was sealed . Jeffrey Berger ably handled the paperwork including an introduction to the tire protection and extended maintenance programs . . I owned a brand new 2002 Mini Cooper . I always regretted not waiting for the S . The new S car drives beautifully , very much like a sports car , and the workmanship and attention to detail is quite extraordinary . And my spouse is happy driving her new top down . I recommend Mini of Edison to any interested buyer or lessee . Pay David and Bill a visit . You will not be disappointed . It is service with a smile all the way . A thoroughly professional dealership under the Open Road banner . Larry GreenMillburn NJ	1

Cruzerlite has been one of my favorite case companies for Android devices . When I used my Galaxy S3 as my daily driver device I always ended up using a Cruzerlite case for my case daily driver . Specifically I used the Android green A2 case for the GS3 . The design is simple but it looks good and thin . The same great designs are now available for the HTC One .What I like about Cruzerlite cases is that they are thin , smooth , pocketable and look great . TPU material is actually very durable . So you will be protected against scrapes , scratches and bumps . The case is raised above the screen so you have the option to place the phone face down without worry of screen damage . The case will protect against most drops . The installation is very easy and all ports / buttons are fully accessible . The Androidified case also has some extra grip on the sides that will help reduce the chances of the dreadful drops .The Smoke Circuit case looks really cool ! The circuitry design stands out . I like the see through wiring that is spread around the back of the case .	1

Wow , I 'm a believer ! I ca n't believe how different this Charmin Ultra Soft really is , the hype actually has some truth to it after all . The paper feels really soft , almost velvety , but surprisingly strong . Charmin 's done a lot to improve the ' shredding ' effect that I always disliked . Like some of the new toilet paper commercials say , toilet paper needs to , first and foremost , get you clean . That 's the whole thing , right ? Charmin Ultra Soft is much improved in that department . And , lo and behold , I did n't need to use as much as before . This paper holds it together much better than other Charmin versions . I think I will be changing brands , and I 'm a hard sell ! Try this , if you even remotely liked Charmin before , this will make your day !	1

I like the Withings scale better than the Fitbit Aria . Both send readings via Wifi to your computer . Interestingly the Withings readings can go on one 's Fitbit dashboard ! If your budget allows and you have an interest , a more expensive Withings scale also has body fat measurement and pulse along with an air quality reading that I think may be worthless info . The more expensive scale comes only in black , unfortunately . But it performs better than the Fitbit Aria .	1

There are uncomfortable bras and then there are actually painful bras . This bra is everything . It 's the most uncomfortable agonizing bra ever . I have a leopard print , and it 's cute , this is the only positive thing about it . Nothing in this bra is flexible , the band seems stretchable but only in your hands and everything changes when you put the bra on . It feels like straps are made of a rope , and truly they are NOT made out of a flexible elastic material , not entirely . As you can see from the picture , only part of the strap on the back is elastic , 2 / 3 of it that goes in front and over the shoulders is smooth but very tough and hard , and does n't stretch . This bra is so painful to wear . I am saving it up until I am no longer alive . It restricts every movement . I can not even breathe while wearing it . The straps dig into my shoulders , the band and wire dig into my ribs . I have deep red lines on my skin after wearing it for a few hours . Even though it 's heavily padded feels like wearing sand bags , it does n't lift for long , and leaves a huge empty space on top I did get right size , I tried 4 different band and cup sizes , they were too small or too big , it actually pushes breasts down not up . I need to adjust and lift them up every 2 minutes , and all day long . It 's impossible to raise arms , the straps do not stretch even a bit and the bra just goes up with your arms and the breasts fall out from underneath the cup . I mean they fall no matter what even if you are standing still and just carefully breathing trying to mind your own business . I do n't know who ever came up with this torturous idea , it 's worse than a corset . No wonder women opt for a surgery ! F ! !	0

Disappointed that when I showed the service department manager Aaron a dent on my car when picking it up for service he went straight to ' it states in our agreement that we are n't responsible for damage .

The problem with all homeopathic stuff is that it might work wonders with one person and the next person , expecting to win the lottery when taking those pills , will be utterly disappointed when there is no discernible effect to observe .So , for me , and me alone , these Jet Lag Relief pills actually worked like a charm .I had a trip to Rome a couple of weeks ago and followed the directions on the box one pill before start , then one pill every two hours , and then one final pill after landing .Usually , when flying to Europe , the second day after arrival , I am one of the living dead . This time , I was tired from the long day of flying my company booked a trip where I had to change planes three times . . . that was 20 cheaper than a direct flight , so they had to do it that way , I guess . . . , but I did not have this catastrophic black hole I fell in .On the trip back to the US , I usually have less severe symptoms , because that is just a very long day instead of a jump in a totally different time zone like the lag to Europe . And here , with these pills , my not so severe Jet Lag exposure was even less it was just not there at all .So , for me those pills worked as advertised , but your mileage may vary . . .	1

It took a week to negotiate a deal for a Sierra 2500HD . The sales person and his manager gave us a price , confirmed the details of the offer . We were pre qualified , negotiated the terms , and when we arrived at the dealership to pick up the car , we were told we had the price that we wanted but the cover we requested and confirmed that was part of the deal would be an extra 1700 . On top of it , Emmett would only say ' opps sorry . ' He told us if he had been involved sooner , he would not have committed to the deal ? The whole experience was a bait and switch . The sales person while very nice , the sales manager had no experience in negotiating a deal and therefore messed up and instead of recognizing this mistake , and making amends with their miscommunication we decided to walk away . This whole experience with this dealership should be a HUGE watch out for all consumers . They also told us because we were from Orange County they would not make any money on the service since we would not bring our vehicle over an hour away . If you are in the market for a car , I would stay clear of doing any business with them .	0
what I received did n't match the picture shown for this item , picture shows wide side and they are actually very narrow . picture shows very black skin , what I receive is a clear smoke color .This is becoming a real problem on Amazon that they do n't seem to care about I have complained several times and I am starting to buy lessonline as I ca n't trust what I will get is what what shown . For online shopping you only have the picture to go by and if you can trust that then the experience becomes a bad one . I know amazon will say you can ship it back and get a refund but for many items shipping it back and the time it would take to do is not worth it . Perhaps this is what Amazon and the sellers are counting on , I stop shopping on Ebay for this reason .	0

hi . i do n't know if it is because i keep your browser tab open , and just check back week to week as i want to check movies , but each time i bring it up on a friday ( usually ) , it sets the date to the last date in the drop down list ( usually the next thursday ) , and tells me it has no information for that date . i always have to use the drop down list and tell it to display movies for today . i think today would be a much more logical default date than next thursday .	0

from the monster at the front taking tickets to the snoody 21 yr old manager i am unimpressed . why ca nt i bring my oen water ? what is the deal with the no bottle policy ? the giant at three front thought he could order us around and even touched my shoulder which i could sue for harrassment and even assault . when i asked your manager why the policy i do n't know its my job to enforce them she offered to hold my bottles in their fridge really ? if i brought in soda , i 'd understand , if i brought in food i 'd understand , if i brought in candy i 'd understand . . . but water ? really ? this is a 3 . 75 dollar theater ! please .	0
just like any other screen protector . its good because you get a few screen covers not just one . it is worth it	1
I asked for brown and they gave me the nasty , nasty burgundy shoes . My order says brown but no . The burgundy matches with NOTHING . They are so ugly . I would exchange but I do n't trust this company . Either they are dishonest and give you whatever shoes because they are out of your color or they hire color blind employees .	0

I 'm on my bike 5 to 6 days a week . It sometimes gets boring . I thought about using earbuds to listen to my phone / i pod , but did n't want to gamble with not being able to hear the traffic around me . I tried a front mounted speaker , which was fine , except I felt like the GoodHumor Man tooling down the street with my tunes blazing . Also , the speaker crapped out after 4 days . Then I saw this pop up on the screen . It sounded like just the ticket , especially with the ability to take phone calls and listen to music on my phone 's mp3 app , without sacrificing hearing the traffic around me in my other ear . I 've had it for almost a week and it 's worked well . If I 'm on a bumpy surface or going fast downhill , it sometimes cuts out momentarily , but nothing I ca n't live with . And Bose 's plastic security system is ingenious . No problems with it moving . We 'll see if the thing holds up , but for now I 'm very happy . It does n't compare to regular music listening headphones , but I knew that going in . Also , I do n't know if the Series 1 version has the ability to listen to music . I have the Series 2 . Finally , needless to say , it 's a great bluetooth earpiece for phone conversations . The advertisement videos on Amazon 's site are in my opinion , accurate and true .	1

My wife swears by the helpful effects of this analgesic balm . She has used it for years and sometimes we 've had a hard time finding it .

Bad Overall , I have wear them for a month , 2 times a week average , and they are completely scratched ! Ugly scratches all over the shoe , the sole is not slip proof , and your feet will stink if you wear them for one day , I have had several other Timberland shoes and was expecting quality from these and instead I have a pair of shoes that only lasted 1 month .	0
Even without a cover on , the iPad Mini just barely fits into this case . You actually have to jam it into the case and there is NO way to fit it in with any kind of cover on . Also , the zippered outside pocket is almost impossible to use because it 's so tight . This would have been a great product if it were about a 1 / 2 inch larger all around . As it is it 's just barely useable and I do not recommend it .	0

I am very happy with these slippers . Very comfortable . Perfect for my needs . We live in a relatively moderate year round climate so I do n't need really warm slippers , though I think these would be perfectly fine for a colder climate . I wanted the solid rubber sole as I do step outside wearing them , and sometimes the driveway or patio is wet due to morning dew or from our lawn sprinklers . The rubber soles do a great job of protecting my feet and preserving the integrity of the slipper . So far they have held up great and seem to be solidly constructed . I do n't wear them for extended periods of time i .e . I do n't lounge around the house in them all day . Usually just an hour or two in the morning or in the evening , so they do n't get a rugged work out by any means . I expect they will last a long time with the way I use them .	1
I 've tried four other covers , including the tough ottorbox commuter , clear CIMO , diztronic black , aduro shell holster , and I like this one the best . I 've realized I do n't need anything as tough as ottorbox , and that mostly I look for something that looks great and feels good in my hands . I did n't realize how light and slim this case was until I tried the others . I still like the Aduro holster and sometimes use it with this case , although it is a bit loose . I also like the material that elago uses it is grippy without feeling too sticky .	1
Time spent at service for an oil change 2 hours ! Returned a week later because there was rattling noise up front under the engine . Determined to be the skid plate because they forgot to install all the bolts in place . Been here for over three hours and still waiting for two bolts to be installed . When I asked the status they still were n't sure , 30 mins later I 'm told they are trying to find the bolts and if they do n't have them we will go from there . Never coming here again . Update Four hours later they found the bolts and installed them , then I was told I needed an EFI cleaning for the fuel injectors and a power steering flush , this vehicle only has 37 K on it . If it really needed this why not tell me this last week when I was here .	0

I wo n't be ordering these jeans from Amazon again . Every time I order them they send something a little different . This time the jeans have a rhinestones pattern on the back pockets . What ? ? ? I was reordering from an old order , just plain Levi 's that I liked , so the pants should be the same . The last time I ordered them , the short or petite length was not short , it was regular length . Rather than pay to send them back I paid to have them shortened . This time I will donate the blingy pants to goodwill .	0
Terrible . The service manager I spoke to was very rude . I have a 2008 Honda Accord V6 . It has been consuming oil at an alarming rate . Last week the check engine light came on . As I began to investigate the problem I found several TSBs had been issued regarding the problem . Even a TSB saying vehicles with multimodel VCM2 would experience misfire due to engine misfire of a fouled plug and a warranty extension had been issued to cover repairs for Model 20082013 Accord V6 . When I explained the oil problem the service manager accused the place where I get my oil changed of not adding enough oil . When I mentioned I had researched this problem and my findings he became even more abrasive and accusatory . I feel so defeated but I guess when you 're the only Honda dealership in town you can afford to treat customers like trash . By the way , as a warning to anyone with this model of car , take it in before the extended warranty expires . I purchased my car used in 02 / 2016 and the extended warranty expired on 02 / 23 / 2016 so I 'm out of luck in getting anything covered . Fortunately I was able to chat online with a Honda representative and he filed a complaint against this dealership and even gave me a case number to followup on . It wo n't help my current situation but hopefully it will help prevent this abuse from happening to another customer .	0

This item is to expensive if you buy it here from Amazon . I bought mine from Macy 's for 14 .99 when they had a sale last week . Too bad that I only bought one because iIt is very cute and comfortable .

Dealership is a 310mile round trip for me . During annual service tech found the clutch master cylinder leaking and needed replacement . Under warranty , so no problem . Part is ordered and appointment is scheduled after it arrives . Take another day to take bike for service to be told AFTER arriving that two bolts were ordered instead of a master cylinder . So , nobody checked the order or the part when it arrived to see if it was actually the part needed to make the repair . Another wasted day and 310mile trip . I could not in good faith recommend this service department . Travel extra time and miles if necessary to reach a dealer that has some quality control checks in place .	0

This fivepack was just a few cents more than the least expensive two pack at the time of writing . They are dated 2012 , and it just turned 2014 , but they supposedly last 810 years in storage and the manufacturer usually uses a pessimistic rating for batteries , in my experience , which means I 'll probably have a chance to use more of them before they lose their life in storage . And then next time my garage door opener battery goes dead , I 'll have an immediate replacement for a small fraction of what they 'd try to take from me at Radio Shack .	1
I bought these for my girlfriend as I use the OptiMen multivitamins and was first off irritated to find out that they come in 120 count vs the 180 with optimen , and then I was further irritated to find out that the womens version is a 2 a day dose . . .so rather than the 180 day supply like mine she has a 60 day supply for the same price . Wtf Optimum Nutrition ? Please fix this and either make a one a day pill with 180 count , or a 320 count 2 a day pill for the same price as the mens vitamin otherwise there is no reason for me to ever buy these again .	0
These did n't come close to meeting my expectations . Although they are referred to as silver forks and silver spoons , they are nothing more than plastic . They are very light . I 'm not sure if they would be strong enough to pick up mashed potatoes . It is true that they are silvercolored . From a distance , they could be confused for real pewter or stainless steel utensils . ALERT they are neither silver or stainless steel , or anything else that would be appropriate for serving . The weight gives it away . They are flimflam . They are a comment on the decline of America purchasing power . Moreover , they scratch easily . If anything , the silver color is a liability . While they feel like cutlery from WalMart , their looks take it to one more level . They look like WalMart with bling .I ca n't believe that these cost 24 . When my wife picked them up , her comment was yuck ! just take them away and forget about it . In other words , they are n't going to be useful .	0

I went in for my first oil change Monday 7 / 17 / 17 . . and the service was HORRIBLE ! ! When i arrived they told me it would be a 3 hr wait and 1 hour before i can even speak to an advisor ! so i said ok i ca nt wait that long ill make an appointment and bring it back then a second lady was like no it wo nt be 3 hours just fill this out and drop your keys off , so I did . . . 2 hrs and 45min later of sitting in the lobby , no one came to update me on anything and i never even spoke to an advisor ! ! I waited that long because i do nt like to bother ! ! When i went to the reception to ask the lady just said oh its done went to go get my keys and that s it no one explained what was done i could n't understand everything on the receipt . . . again i never spoke to an advisor basically the receptionist attended me . . . for an upscale dealer and for the amount we pay for our BMW 's that was not acceptable at all ! !	0

I had an amazing experience while at Audi Brooklyn . The showroom is beautiful just like the inventory . Buying a car can be an overwhelming experience , but in this case I felt very comfortable , especially thanks to Bianca , who assisted my husband and I . Bianca is very knowledgeable and patient , she answered all of our questions , and never made us feel rushed , and believe me , in hindsight I can see we were not the easiest customers to deal with . Thank you for such excellent customer service . Now hopefully we can make up our minds soon and go get my new car ! !	1
Worst experience ever . Only reason i gave one star is because I could not give a ZERO . Bought used certified pre owned in Feb 2017 . Since then , the car has been in the shop almost on a monthly basis for an average of a week each time . First issue , brought the car home after just buying it and noticed a dog toy under seat and coins and bobby pins in broken front DC adapter . The adapter also came right out of molding . Second , multiple issues with the passenger seat belt warning light coming on . Upon picking the vehicle up after the second servicing , noticed grease and dried blood on seat . Then , on another occasion leaving service dept . with the loaner , I receive a phone call asking if they can bring me a different car because the loaner was actually a sold vehicle . Now just had it in for the third time for the same seat belt issue and got my car back with grease stains on top of passenger seat and on the panels by the windshield . If I remember correctly BMW is supposed to be a luxury car dealership . Buying a certified pre owned car from Gebhardt BMW was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made .	0

I bought two pairs of Docker khaki 's , a pair ofD1and this D3 ' classic ' fit . While the D1 was amazing and fit perfectly as I 'd imagine but these were just horrible . The first thing I noticed was the cut before I even put them on . These were hideous looking and it is not even remotely close to the picture I posted some pics . They appeared fat and baggy and when tried them on it they made me look like a hiphop fan . One of the reviewers here stated that he 's also gotten different sizings . Returned this and kept the awesome D1 .	0
Pretty good selection , ok prices . It 's a motorcycle store , so it 's just what you would expect . Nothing above and beyond , but this is a great place to go if you are looking for something local . Edit just talked to a buddy Nathan Baker who actual just told me what you guys did to him .

I like these so so much better than the regular wetjet pads ! they remove so much more , and my floors look a lot better , in less time , with less effort ! what s not to love ? they are the same as the regular wetjet pads , but with the mr .clean majic eraser added , which I really can tell a difference , it makes the floor shinier , and also removes tough stains , or just marks / stains / spills , ect a lot lot easier than the regular ones do , so I will be buying these , and only these from now on ! very much recommended !	1

A circus from the beginning ! My serviceman was Patrick . I was less than impressed . I was from Philadelphia and my car bottomed out on those wonderful NYC roads 55 th Street manhole cover sticks 5 inches out of the road . . a new transmission and 10 , 500 repair bill later I was not offered a rental car until 4 days later being stuck in a Ford that my insurance provided . I called Patrick 4 days after my car was towed there and he told me I 'll put you on a wait list , I have no car for you . . 8 days post damage , I called the manager and went postal about a loaner , THEN , they all the sudden had one available . who knew ? . Ironically , my daughter became sick the day it became available and I could n't pick it up . I texted Patrick twice during the times they had my car asking when the part was scheduled to arrive without response . . I showed up yesterday to get my car , paid the bill , got into my car and the tire pressure light was on . I had to wait longer for them to take my car back and fix that . They had messed up the time on my car as well , not bothering to fix it . Not once , by anyone at that dealership did anyone saythank you . I just paid for a 10k repair bill without a loaner being offered until day 8 , and I ca n't get a thank you ? Unreal ! My Mercedes dealer in West Chester PA would have never treated me like that . Service there is impeccable ! Craig Mulenbach and Faz Mehmood totally hooks me up every time I visit with a loaner , a smiling face and a warm greeting every time I visit ! I totally love my car and MY Mercedes dealership . This dealership leaves much to be desired when it comes to customer service . Thumbs down . . . my experience there was rotten !	0

First oil change on my 2015 WRX , the tech stalled my car . Who works at a dealership and ca n't drive stick ? Second , there is a recall on my car for a emissions issue . They have blown me off twice for the fix . I setup a appointment at 730am , and they tell me they have n't even started because whoever took my order set it up as a smog . Does n't need to be smogged till 2019 but you know It was their bad , but they want me to come back later because they do n't have time . If I was n't doing forced to go here for a recall I would never go here ever . I am in the process of contacting suburu corporate , that 's how bad my experience e has been with them .	0

These are large clear gel capsules containing the brightest yellow curcumin I 've ever seen . It 's that bright color that makes me realize these are high potency high quality supplements .I'm a long time user of turmeric , the South Asian spice which is the principal source for curcumin , for over ten years . I have always encapsulated my own pills to save money , using a simple plastic tray called CapMQuick to fill my own large empty capsules . But it 's messy .I'm switching to this . I love the Jarrow brand and it is now my favorite and preferred brand of supplements . These are strong and I only need to take one of these per day instead of two a day as I have always done . Curcumin is not available in synthetic form .I did a little research and found this in Wikipedia34Laboratory research shows that curcumin is a pleiotropic molecule possibly capable of interacting with molecular targets involved in inflammation . In vitro , curcumin modulates the inflammatory response by downregulating the activity of cyclooxygenase2 , lipoxygenase , and inducible nitric oxide synthase enzymes and inhibits several other enzymes involved in inflammation mechanisms .34Here is a reason you might want to try taking two or even three of these spread out during the day34In Phase I clinical trials , dietary curcumin was shown to exhibit poor bioavailability i .e . , low levels in plasma and tissues .Potential factors that limit the bioavailability of curcumin include poor absorption , rapid metabolism , and rapid systemic elimination . Numerous approaches to increasing curcumin bioavailability have been explored , including the use of adjuvants like piperine .The bioavailability of curcumin ingested in foods may be increased as a result of cooking or dissolution in oil .34Unfortunately it 's not all good news about curcumin34In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that curcumin can have carcinogenic effects .34If you have a problem with inflammation anywhere , this is certainly worth a try . It has helped my knees feel better as well as my back . And as a daily user of Turmeric for over ten years I have not come down with cancer . I will continue to buy this . One pill of Jarrow Curcumin Phytosome 500 mg per day is plenty to get results . It works for me .	1

I thought I was onto something great here . Smells great and very effective in eliminating any armpit odor .

Being in I .T . I 've always kept a second battery on hand and avoid any device with nonremovable . For shame Apple Motorola . . not that your devices can compare anymore anyhow . This charger / stand works great . I keep it next to my desk for easy retrieval of both phone and battery . Honestly , over 6 months I 've only ever needed the battery once and it was due to an overnight since my S3 lasts well past a full work day . Regardless , as the universe works it is in those times when you do n't have the charge or extra battery that they can be life or death .Highly recommend .	1
first off , with a husband and family and all that entails , i 'm a total dressforless kinda shopper ross , burlington , marshalls , outlets , etc . . and do n't consider 32 for a top for myself to be an inexpensive purchase . based on all the positive reviews , i had high hopes for this top and this clothing line which were quickly dashed when i received this . i did n't receive it in a ' box ' like i had been to a ' boutique ' it arrived in a plastic envelope inside a clear plastic bag bigger than a quart size but smaller than a gallon size , wrinkled beyond belief , exactly as i 'm presuming pattyboutik received it from china , where this blouse is made and i 'm sure where all their other items are , too . color is off from item photo much more green than blue , and brighter , material is ok thin , clingy , somewhat cottony in feel even though it 's a 50 / 50 viscose poly blend . all in all , just not a quality purchase . have bought similar tops for about 1214 from other retailers an offtheshoulder peasant top is n't exactly a unique design . very disappointed .	0

I realize this 5x magnifier was not expensive but I thought the BL name would carry some quality with it . As is , I would rate the quality of this magnifier to be equal to or just slightly above an item I would find in the 99 cents store .This magnifier collapses into the handle to make a 2 x 15 / 8 x 5 / 8 square . It also comes in a padded BL labeled draw string carry sack which seems like a complete waste of money . I do n't know why they did n't spend the money that went into the BL labeled sack into a slightly better lens .I bought this magnifier to view small print on grocery items and vitamins bottles , etc . while shopping . The thing I do n't like about the lens is that if you do n't hold it exactly right , it curves and distorts the image .I added a picture above which compares this magnifier to a no name 5x plastic loop I bought from a street vendor for a few dollar . The loop is 11 / 8 long with a 11 / 2 diameter at the eye end , and a 1 diameter on the lens end , and so is a bit bulkier to carry than the BL magnifier .But the loop does n't distort the image and is easier to use , held both to the eye and away from the eye . BL might not believe me but I took the best pics I could with each , held both next to the camera viewfinder , and away from it , showing very much what my eye saw .If you do n't mind an image that distorts while you are trying to focus while shopping in the grocery store , this magnifier is fine .EDIT June 16 , 2012After having this a week I lowered my rating from 2 stars Not Great , to 1 star Useless Garbage . Rather than waste the postage and effort to return it , I threw it in the garbage . The thing that makes this unusable is a very short working distance . If you focus the glass , then move it closer or farther by even a 16th of an inch , the image distorts like a fun house mirror . While the pic I added showed a passable image if the glass , subject and your eye the camera in this case are perfectly still , if you are holding the glass and object in your hands you ca n't be perfectly still , especially if you are trying to scan across anything wider than the glass . I just tried to read the label ingredients on food , and made myself seasick . This is actually the worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon .	0

I purchase this in hoping that it can also charge my Asus Transformer Prime TF201 . Unfortunately , it does n't . However , it does charge my IPad 2nd and 3rd generation . I would give this product a 5 stars if it can also charge Asus tablet as well .Updated 03 / 01 / 2013I only use this once to make sure that it is working properly and could be used as a backup charger . For unknown reason it does n't work when I bring it on my recent trip . When I plug into my Ipad 2nd and 3rd generation , both report as not charging . Therefore I am force to revise the review to one star .	0

I tried using this on a highback desk chair for which I wanted some additional lumbar support .It fits onto the chair fairly easily . All the straps are quite long although I did not measure them , so fitting even on a highback chair was easy . E .g . The strap that goes over the top of the seat back fits on a highback chair easily .To me , it feels thick and lumpy . It pushed me forward in the chair , reducing the chair 's otherwise very good thigh support . The lumpiness made it uncomfortable . Quite the opposite of the desired result ! I have stopped using it and I consider it useless . It will get thrown out at some point .TheBackUp by Nada Chair Blackis far more effective in encouraging good posture and providing support . It is a different sort of product than this Fellowes back support .	0

Easy to deal with . I have been buying my motorcycles from a dealer on the West Coast for many years . When I was ready to purchase again both my old dealer and these guys had the bike I wanted . These guys treated me like a repeate client and the other guys treated me like a stranger in pricing , customer relations and just over all . My old dealer , after learning of his short comings tried to match . . but , why could n't he have done that out of the gate ? Dave and his crew did everything they said they would and deoversee the bike to me . Nice Work	1

Sometimes it is necessary while working in my wood shop to shed my wrist watch along with any other jewelry on my hands or wrists before using most machines . For this reason , I was in the market for an accurate timepiece that was easily accessible and easily read . So I began to search my friendliest sales location , Amazon .com , to see if they could help solve my problem . Sure enough , I found a variety of pocket watches and the black steel one was the one in which I chose . It was priced right and it runs with a quartz movement for accuracy . I am wearing it now and as an old fogy in blue jeans , it has taken nearly 70 years to figure out why that small pocket above the regular right side pocket is referred to as the watch pocket . The watch is beautifully finished in bright shiny black and the Arabic numbers are easily read . Further more , the lid which easily operates with one hand is there to always protect the watch crystal . This watch is both functional and aesthetic and does bring back some very fond memories of the older days seeing Grandpa or the train conductor reach for and read his pocket watch .SMS	1

Very frustrating experience purchasing a couple of Sea Doo Sparks from these guys . We chose Ride Now because of the few dealers in the area recommended by Sea Doo , they seemed to have much better pricing / sales and much more inventory , as well as high customer reviews . So we went in September 4thMonday and talked with a salesman who said inventory on Sparks was somewhat limited being so late in the season , but we could track down two available Sparks from Ride Now 's huge network of dealers . He talked us into looking for Sparks with better options and my wife wanted a blue one seeing the other colors , and I was after a matching blue or a green . After about 3040 minutes , we were told there were no blues available anywhere , but we could get a green and a white from two nearby stores . We said that would work and paid 200 to secure these two jet skis . While this was going on , they were working on the loan approval but as it was Labor Day , the banks were all closed so we were fine waiting a day to finalize the deal . The next day , I do n't hear anything from Ride Now so I call in the afternoon to see how things were going and apparently they are still trying to figure out the loan and as far as bringing in the two Sparks , I was given the impression they were good to go and on the way . Finally on Wednesday , I get a call that the loan is good to go and we can come in and get everything finalized . I ask again about the white and green Sparks being on their way , and I was given a very iffy answer . . . We come in around 530 to go over all the pricing and Holy Crud ! ! We could have about bought a 3rd jet ski with all the hidden fees that just popped out . I understand that every dealer has dealer fees to cover , but we had to pay a ton for freight charges as well . . . And then , when we ask where the two Sparks are , we get a nervous laugh , and hear white and green ? ? you . . uh . . . meant white and red right ? . . . haha . . . Apparently our deposit did n't actually secure the green one we were told was available , and the white one was n't even on its way to the dealer as it was n't even secured yet ! Back to the freight , I could understand paying a fee to transfer the Sparks from one dealer to another , but then I find out that the red Spark we are now getting is actually sitting at this dealer , as is the trailer we purchased . . . so how much sense does that make that I am paying freight for these items as they are sitting there already ? ! Nothing really comes from asking about these charges other than that we are paying it cause the dealer had to pay it originally to bring the Sparks in from Sea Doo . We talk and the payment is decent so we suck it up and sign off on it . Then we sit and wait for an hour while they get everything ready . The dealer closes at 700 , we are brought back at 705 to sign with the finance guy . This goes relatively smooth with only a few hiccups . We finally get out of there around 800 with hopes that we could pick up the Sparks the next day . Guess what , white Spark is still sitting . . . somewhere . . . and not in transit . I am told that it will be at the dealer by 600 that night Thursday , 4 days after we secured two Sparks to transfer to the store . Disappointing yes , but OK we will pick up Friday . I get a call around 1100 on Friday that everything is finally in one place and being prepped for pick up at this point I assume this means the white one did n't actually show up till that morning . We show up that afternoon and go through a brief walk through where I realize that I probably know more about the Sparks than their service tech does , and also find that they forgot the covers we paid for . So we wait another hour or so while they figure that out . After what seemed to be a good start , I was very disappointed how this was all handled given this dealer 's high reviews from other customers as well as having Sea Doo 's best Platinum Certification . I would never come back to Ride Now for any service , parts or future purchases .	0

The seller ships fast ! I received this product 2 days after my order . I have been trying this Raspberry Ketones Pure for about a week . I take 20 drops under my tongue in the morning as instructed . The taste is amazing good , much tasty than I expected . It suppressed my appetite obviously . I usually craved food between meals . But this week , I can actually skip the snack time . Although , I am eating less , I still have good energy for the day , feeling quite good really . After a week taking this drops , I went on the scale this morning , I have lost 1 .5 lbs . Pretty good result for a week without exercising .Absolutely great product and highly recommend to everyone !	1
About 2 weeks ago , we brought our delivery vehicle 2013 Nissan NV200 in to get checked as it was not blowing cold air . Charleston Nissan charged us nearly 2500 to fix . About 1 week after the vehicle was supposed to be fixed a sharp burning smell was sensed when using the air conditioning . The vehicle was brought back and we were told that it required another 500600 fix . When we ask why this is happening we get the following answer . parts break that is what extended warranty is for .	0
i have such a deep and utter hatred for your website . on too many occasions your website times out on us while trying to purchase tickets . the site then goes into a glitch and shortens the time to buy tickets by several minutes every time we go back to try again . our theater has a very limited number of seats and uses a reserved seats only policy . after your website times out on us the seats that we picked are marked as unavailable , even tho we are the ones who attempted to reserve them . i was also very disheartened by the lack of phone numbers to call for help with this matter .	0

I bought this tshirt in 5 different colors white , black , royal blue , ash , light steel . I wear them for pj tops , primarily , but also for layering . I was expecting ComfortSoftHanes trademark , but that 's not what I got . I only wear Hanes underwear , and mostly , their short sleeve tshirts . I buy them under the ComfortSoft label , as they 're very comfortable , wash well , and are very durable . These Tagless shirts are not ! They 're made of a heavier weight cotton , and they 're somewhat scratchy , right out of the dryer . They did fit well , right out of the bag , but started shrinking , the first time I washed them . The white one , in particular , has shrunk in the arms to where they go halfway up my forearms . The others have n't shrunk as much , but are very snug right now , and I ca n't imagine how much longer I 'll be able to wear them . I 've only had them about 6 weeks . Incidentally , I came back to Amazon today , and searched for ComfortSoft long sleeve tees . I found some , from a different supplier , but there was a note at the top of the screen that I had ordered these previously . When I put some in my cart , and went to check out , they had surprisingly changed from ComfortSoft , to Tagless , so I deleted them . I guess I 'll have to find them somewhere else . I am VERY disappointed in Hanes right now .	0
This place is a rip off ! I brought my GX in for the parking emergency brake to get repaired along with a very very expensive AC system repair . First the e brake repair order says it functioning as designed , NOPE ! the tech wrote that he inspected the rear brakes then took off the rear rotors to find the springs on wrong ! Anyone who knows about this brake system knows the springs are color coded and to put them on wrong would take a rocket scientist ! The spec is for the e brake to hold up to 200 rpm , well my handle does nt work and even holding it up manually the brake does nt hold at all ! BUT it works as designedWHAT A JOKE ! My ac was making a loud noise when it was turned on , the tech guessed and wroteREPLACE COMPRESSOR ? With a ? ? and all , the service writer told me that ! So after the winter I went to use the air , guess what ? ! ? ! Loud noise and ac not blowing cold ! I have had issues with the dealer since day 1 . They replaced my dash , BROKE my cup holder and put it in a bag and placed it in my glove box ! There were broken clips and parts left in it on the floor . They dropped a clip down where my dvd player doors are , I took a scope , yes I am in the industry , and saw the yellow plastic in the way . Of course when I picked it up the service advisor gave me attitude and showed me a plastic bag of what else might of been down there , of course there was no clip ! The service manager who is nt 1 at all , actually told me they do nt want me to come there anymore ! THEN because I posted negative reviews ACTUALLY CALLED THE POLICE ON ME ! ! ! ! ! I am dealing with corporate , then the states attorney and then the BBB I am going to take them to arbitration ! DONT BRING YOUR VEHICLE HERE ! ! ! !	0

I loved the look of this humidifer .I bought the orange one and it blended nicely with my decor . However , the seal which holds the water cracked after the 3rd week of use . Embarassing part , this is my second purchase of the same humidifier . The first one did the same exact thing , but on the 3rd month . Offically given up on this brand , though the look of it rocks , it did n't work for me . I used distilled water as instructed , so I have no idea what voodoo curse has been placed on me with humidifiers , but there ya go . . .	0

Most of us spend a fair amount of time and money looking for the perfect case for our phones . I think this New Trent Rugged case is very close . It 's no Otterbox , for sure , but then , not everyone needs that kind of protection . This case is a well made , easy to attach , medium duty unit .There are three pieces to it the rigid piece that contains the screen protector , the semisoft back and sides and a small rigid back section . The accompanying photos show the pieces and sequence for assembly . and that assembly is very easy . All the parts fit the iPhone and each other very well . All controls work as usual the charging port and ringer switch have liftup covers .After several days of use , I found that the sound quality is excellent for the ear piece , the external speaker and for those on the other end to hear / understand me . I have an after market screen protector on my screen and purposely left it one to check sensitivity with the New Trent case over it . To my delight there is no loss of touch . All motions are just as exact and quick as before . There are a couple places where the case screen protector appears to be adhering to the screen , but this in no way affects the use or viewing . Others have mentioned that the plastic used for the screen protector attracts dust , which it does but , this may be a function of the drier air of winter .Finally , I 'm not sure of the purpose of the rigid partial back piece , but I have to admit that I 'm glad it 's there it makes for a great attachment point for my iMagnet car mount plate ! Bottom line I find this New Trent product to be exactly as advertised . As a medium duty splash , dust and bump case that walks that line between protection and bulk New Trent has hit the mark . Definitely 5 stars .	1

I love buying cheap costume jewelry . . .fun to wear , fun to put as accessories for Halloween costumes . This piece is awful . Some of the stones were missing and the ones that were n't were glued in so you see the white glue . It is also HUGE . I would never buy this specific necklace again .	0

So far this case has been so awesome . I mean it 's a lil bulky but I like it that way though . I think it 's the easy thing now that I can have a wallet on one side cuz I hated carrying my wallet in one arm and my phone in my other now I can carry it all together with my important cards and money I love it ! !	1
I should have realized just how big these earrings are . . . . .but I did n't . I thought they would be delicate . . . . .they are not . They are too big for me . Make sure you know how big an inch and a half is . . . .sounds small , but not when it 's hanging from your ear ! If you like big earrings . . . .these are not heavy .	0

I switched my phone to Straight Talk and ported my number . After 2 days I could suddenly no longer make or receive calls .Over the next week I spent a MINIMUM of 15 hours on the phone with the customer service reps . I was transferred no less than 40 times , and had to reexplain the situation EACH TIME . I was told just one more moment several thousand times . I was sent 3 replacement SIM cards . I was told to wait 24 hours and everything will work five times . I know it ca n't POSSIBLY be my phone because it worked for 2 days .And then after all this I was told by one rep that if I got angry with her she would hang up on me .Well , my patience ran out . I ported my number to a real cell phone carrier and it was up and running in 15 minutes .Trust me . This company is a JOKE ! Totally useless ! ! ! !	0

My husband has the Ballistic SG Maxx case seen here http // www .amazon .com / gp / product / B008D4X804 / refwmsohsproduct ? ieUTF8psc1 and it is AMAZING . I always used the cheapo cases until I cracked my screen recently and have decided to up the protection on my replacement phone .I got this thinking it would be the same quality of protection and was extremely dissapointed ! ! ! This case has two pieces one in front , and one in back . The pieces only snap together in the four corner flaps and no where else the point at which the front connects to the back is held only by rubber does n't snap together like most phone cases . . The top sides do n't snap together at all and so are left semi open and exposed to dust and whatever gets near the phone .The whole reason I got this is for protection and with such flimsy connections holding the case on , I see no way that this case could withstand a fall . I can remove the corner flaps from the case extremely easily and only two need to be undone for the phone to slip right out .The case works well in every other way with buttons holes in the right place , and the plastic in the front is easy to see through and touch through . . . but it is a major design flaw that it does n't stay on .My husband 's Ballistic case has a different sort of logo , which includes the R . . . this case does n't include that . I wonder if it is really a Ballistic brand case , or just a knock off .Very disappointing .	0

This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial . It looked so simple , easy and convincing .But this product is nothing like it claims . First of all , it is finicky to use and often did nothing you can tell because the light was not flashing . When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming . I spent a lot of time on a small area , because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result . To treat an area sized 23 inches I needed to spend several hours . It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway . The product claims that it will not grow back over time , but the hair does grow back .I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial . I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were . It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund , but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No ! no ! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it .I DID NOT LIKE1 Hard to use2 Did not work on all hair3 Took a lot of time to produce poor results4 Hair grew back5 Return process was difficultI LIKED1 Commercial . Sigh . . . .No ! NO ! NO ! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! ! Ali Julia review	0

Simple . Took about a minute to figure out how it worked , thanks in part to the handy quick start guide . Basically , install batteries OR attach the provided AC adapter , attach the cuff , and press start I did set the date and time in between , which is optional . The reading takes about 30 seconds or so , with the cuff inflating and then deflating as expected . The cuff , by the way , is n't totally floppy . The part that goes around your arm is preformed into a tacotype springy shape that fits around your arm , and then you wrap the extra cuff material around and secure with velcro . Very easy for one person to put on themselves . The cuff is extra long , and some of it just hangs loose or can be secured with additional velcro on the end , not a big deal . The measurement seemed accurate based on my past readings , and the unit has plenty of advanced features , most of which I may never use multireading averaging , the 60test log , etc . It 's nice to have the large readout the numbers are n't hard to see , which includes both blood pressure readings systolic and diastolic and a pulse measurement . I suppose the main unit could be smaller , but it 's not heavy , and not too big to stash away on a bathroom shelf somewhere .Anyway , it 's a handy , easy to use unit , with a clear display , which comes with a carrying case for keeping it all together . A good choice , I think .	1

As I say in the title , the case fight tightly on the phone , and only takes a little fiddling to align every hole with every button . The sides are a decent compromise between being too rubbery / grippy and slick / slippery . A nice middleoftheroad between not making it too hard to get out of the pants pocket and unsafe to hold .I bought one of these for my wife as well . She thinks the phone is bulkier and heavier now , but that can not be avoided if you want safety and protection .	1
a group of us went to see the 2 pm showing of gone with the wind . it was a fiasco ! first it did not start until 2 45 p . m . which was 45 mins late . then at the intermission they could not get it back on for an hour . the mgmt . came in and told us it would be back in 5 minutes , noy true more like 30 minutes . we were about to leave and it came back on . so now we are almost 4 hrs into the movie , including all the interruptions . the movie had about 10 mins left and the sound goes off , the lights come on and the movie is now ruined . everyone was very upset and we all walked out and demanded our money back . it was the most mis managed , unorganized process i have ever seen . the mgmt . made excuses but really they should have just told us at intermission there were issues and gave us our money back then . it has been a very long time since i have been to the movies , guess it will be again . really bad experience .	0
I 've had this phone for 2 weeks . It was just released in December so it 's a very new ATT Go Phone . The specs are amazing for the price 4 g , 5mp camera with flash , fast processor , android 4 .1 , good battery life beats battery life on our iPhone , and 434 screen . It is actually a ZTE Z740 phone . Call quality is excellent , WiFi reception is similar to my previous iPhone , speaker is good . This is a great android phone for the price and I would highly recommend it . Had a Nokia Lumia 520 and I like this , but ATT Radiant much betterpictures taken are much better on the Radiant also especially with the flash . The only drawback is that there are no fitted cases yet , but that 's only because it is so new .	1

It took me a while to review these strips because I could n't figure out a way to evaluate them properly . I experimented with taking pictures at a specific distance or extreme closeups . There was just too much variance from one picture to the next to be able to come up with an objective beforeandafter picture . Later I had one of those Doh moments after realizing I did n't have to take a picture at all . Since I have a top and bottom set of teeth , I could simply use the strips on one set and leave the other set asis . Both sets of teeth would be eating and drinking the same items so I should be able to make an accurate comparison . I realize a movement from one shade of white to another is almost undetectable but visible whitening , as the advertising claims , should be easy to spot . I worried I might end up with awkward looking teeth depending on how well the whitestrips work but it 's not the first time I 've embarrassed myself for a review .Each whitestrip comes in a flat foil package and contains two strips , one for the uppers and another for the lowers . Crest has done a pretty good job of making the peroxide stay on the strip in gel form as you peel it off but any slip while putting on the strips and the gel will wipe on whatever it touches . It 's an awkward process but gets easier after the 2nd or 3rd application . For me , the bigger issue was the irritation these strips cause to my gums . In spite of my current redneck residence , I was blessed with a full set of teeth and no overbite . These strips fold over the teeth to the point where the gel gets on to the gums and in between teeth . I suppose it 's good for complete coverage of the teeth but it really irritates the gums . It was bad enough that I waited an extra day after the first two applications so the irritation would go away . Bruxism sufferers , I also noted increased sensitivity to hot and cold while using the strips .Aside from the initial irritation , I stuck to the directions , leaving the strips on for at least half an hour each day , usually around 45 minutes before going to bed . Once the box was finished I started asking people if they noticed a difference in my teeth without telling them why . Nobody was able to notice anything out of the ordinary . Then I explained I whitened only half my teeth to see if there was a difference . Still no one could see a difference and neither could I . Laughably , a couple of people said something along the lines of Now that you mention it , the top does look whiter than the bottom . I used the whitestrips on the bottom teeth .In conclusion , this product is worthless a complete waste of money . The Vivid Whitestrips are advertised as the most affordable choice . There are Advanced Vivid and Professional Effects options that are purported to provide more dramatic results but I have n't tested them .	0
I had bought a brand new lexus here in 2011 , it was a 5 stars experience , but this time is the worst car shopping experience ever in my life time ! Currently I purchase a 14 Toyota Tacoma XSPX in preown center , buying process was very good , salesman is nice and price was good . then 2 weeks later I found out my Tradein 's loan still active and not being payoff , I tried to contact Finance Dept and left a few messages , no one call me back , I have to called my salesperson to help me get a hold of someone to help , I tried many times called to my bank and Lexus finance then found out they sent the payoff check to the wrong bank , I have to spent two weeks to called both my bank and lexus to get this done right . the person who handled this never called me during my frustration , only the finance dept manager Kim called and get this issue fixed right away . Now , the other issue now is I still have not receive my new registration , I purchased this truck on 07 / 30 / 17 , my birthday month is August , I had my new registration with a yellow decal for my tradein , they took it with the decal , they said I will have a new one in the mail . I never receive my registration , so I called on 08 / 28 / 17 , no one called me back , so I called my salesman again , he said he will ask them to sent me a copy again , I wait til 09 / 05 / 17 to get my copy of the registration , but there is no yellow decal , I text to my salesman again but no reply til this moment , I sent an email to the woman who handle the payoff , she replied an email said she is not handle tag and registration and already forward my email to the right person , but there is no right person call me til this moment , I have not drive my truck since 09 / 01 / 17 because I do n't want to get pull over with an expired decal on my license plate ! I need my license plate decal ! ! ! this is the worst customer service ever ! after I purchased the truck , no one care about me anymore , even my salesman is getting annoyed because I have to called or text him to get someone ! I had purchased 2 lexus from Lexus of Clearwater and 1 lexus from this one , always great services ! maybe this time I buy pre own so I do n't get the same customer sercives ? ? ?	0

Yes it 's a prettier cool looking bottle on the sink but the first thing that comes to mind when trying to decide if it 's good or bad is simply the question WHY ? First of all it does n't cut grease even close to DAWN and the smell is not all that great . The smell at first reminded me of tea and nothing at all of ginger or pomelo but then it gets heavy and it lingers and you find yourself washing your hands a lot to get rid of this ever lingering not so great smell . Even the glasses and dishes take on this overwhelming smell . If you need aroma therapy in the kitchen buy a glade candle and buy a real dish soap to do the dishes , sorry but this is not it .	0

I could not be any more happier with my experience at Northwest BMW . I owned BMW in Europe , but found that here the purchase process is much different . I expected it to take a week to get deal done . I worked with the most professional , well spoken , and courteous sales advisor Duane . He and his team made purchasing new BMW very simple . I did n't get the run around , like other dealerships in the area . Duane did n't waste my time with a bunch of back and forth . We picked out car , went over numbers , and did the deal ! When you are treated with respect , and have a real professional who knows what he is doing , it makes a difference . Mark the finance guy was great too . If you are looking for BMW or any other vehicle , call Northwest BMW and ask for Duane in sales a real professional	1
If I could rate zero stars I would ! My friend and I went to this dealership because I m in the market for a new 340 . Now I know that it is nt the most expensive car but as I want it it would be 5060k . We looked around and had FOUR salespeople walk past us and not even say hi or acknowledge we even existed . In all we were there for 30 minutes and the only time someone spoke to us was as we were walking to leave there was a bay on the showroom floor open to the outside with a car that caught my eye and we were just looking at it not even touching it and someone rushed over to tell us it was sold and we needed to get away from the car and very rudely at that . . . . I guess because I m in my 30s and looking at BMWs I just am not worth their time . . . I even called to speak with a sales manager and he was busy and I was told to leave a voicemail . . . I did and not even bothered to give me a phone call back . . . a phone call would have given a chance for them to earn my business and make it right but they ca nt even do that ? ! ? !	0
Just A FYIStay away from this service department , they were way off on diagnosing our problem . I am a firsttime BMW owner and had a terrible experience . Had to have my X3 towed to Reading BMW in Oct 2016 because engine quit running , which was still under factory warranty , the service department stated , after reviewing the situation that it will not be covered under warranty because the wrong oil was used wrong viscosity and that we needed a new engine . After some research , we discovered that the wrong oil was NOT used , but BMW of Reading would hear nothing of it . The cost of the new engine would be over 18 , 000 . 00 , and yes we were told by the Supervisor at BMW of Reading that if we would have been a longtime BMW owner they would do more for our situation . Finally , after much frustration and deliberating on Feb 2017 we had a reevaluation with Lancaster BMW , they totally disagreed with Readings findings including the idea of The wrong OIL and within a week the vehicle was fixed with a bill of 2 , 700 . 00 . Thanks for nothing Reading service department ! ! BE ADVISED PEOPLE OF READING AND SURROUNDING CITIES STAY AWAY FROM BMW of READING ! ! ! ! ! !	0

I really like this portable charger ! It is very rugged and I am able to charge two devices at the same time without being near electricity . I took this fishing and charged my phone while sitting on the dock . Another great feature is that I get 2 to 3 uses off a single charge , and that includes charging my 10 inch tablet and smart phone together . I mentioned it is rugged and I mean it . You can drop it , spill water on it and it is going to keep on working . If you need a portable charger I highly recommend this one . Well worth the extra money as you will use it for years to come .	1
The sale staff is dishonest and only interested in taking your money . They 're misleading and manipulative . After sale support is nonexistent . Stay away from Magic City and their sister dealer BMW Motorcycles of Daytona . They 're pure EVIL . Just an update . The loan on the 2017 Ducati Panigale I traded in on the BMW SK1rr has n't been paid off by the dealer . They recently sold the Panigale . Hopefully the dealership will have enough money to paid off my loan . It 's been over three weeks . If they do n't pay soon , I 'm going to have to make a payment on a bike I do n't own . The bike was a tradein , not consignment . The dealership is using my credit because they are unwilling or unable to pay the loan off .	0

These undies are either designed for men with small packages or women . There is no pouch area in front , which makes for a hysterical ballbearing scenario . I rarely give 5 or 1 star ratings , but these skivvies deserve it . Add insult to injury you pay for return postage .	0

I ordered this based on all the reviews raving about it and was extremely disappointed . It fits HUGE . I am 5'8 and generally wear a medium . This fit like a XXL or bigger on me . It looked like a tent . I would not recommend this to anyone I know . I tried to add a picture but this review forum wo n't allow me to at this time .	0
i want you to know how angry and disapointed i am with your service . i waited a very very long time both on the chat and the phone to see why it kept saying my stubs card was not valid , yet it is linked to my account and i have purchased tickets in the past through your site . it is really bad service that after at least 20 minutes wasted nobody answered either way . terrible service ! i ended up paying the convenience charge because my free time is worth more than that .	0

I bought 2 packs and was very disappointed in the way they fit . The crotch area is very small , narrow and uncomfortable . After the first wash some of the seams came apart . I still have the second package that I will never open . They just do n't fit right . I spent the extra money and bought Jockey brand and they fit perfectly .	0
i placed an order and received an email confirmation . the link that is supposed to give me instructions on how to get my ticket returns a message that the order does not exist . the link that says send me a mobile ticket returns a message that says the service is not available . the customer service phone number on your web has a message saying the mailbox is full and hangs up . the live chat window says the wait time is 23 minutes when i first connected , and after waiting 15 minutes it says my wait time is now 35 minutes . my credit card has been charged and i have no tickets . this is officially the worst on line ordering experience i have ever had . never again fandango ! on the long shot chance that you actually care , here is my confirmation number 81600594683763 , and you can call me at 619 318 6840 .	0

Really pretty . I would recommend to a friend . Receives lots of complements when I wear it . Nice piece to add to your collection .	1
Went in for service at 945am , the service rep stated it would be a quick service . I text the rep at 336p no response on how much longer , I called and left a message 350p , no response . 400p was unable to find the rep so I walk up to the counter and the cashier went to find my rep . To make a long story short I got my car at 445p . Will never go back , they need to learn a little customer service ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Communication goes a long way ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

This is a fantastic headset . I like that it 's unobtrusive .It 's not the greatest fit in the ear , but it more than makes up for that with everything else . This version does not come with replacement ear gels as the retail version does .Call quality is great on both ends of the call .Combine this headset with the My Motospeak app to control phone calls and text messages with your voice . This works quite well , but you have to speak punctuation with your text messages which is a bit annoying and not terribly accurate .I love that the headset is easily turned on / off by rotating the eartip . It autoconnects quickly so quickly that you can answer a phone call by pulling it out of the charging case , and placing it in your ear .And the charging case ! What a great idea ! It protects the headset and charges it . The indicator lights on both the case and the headset keep you informed of charge levels . The case makes this headset great for pockets .	1

This did n't last very long . I bought a cheapo one for less than 5 and it 's superb compared to this one . It even has a USB stick on the other end , this one does n't . This has a short miniusb / usb charging cable that can get lost easily . The stove on it is already burnt out . What a disappointment . Save your money for one of the other cheaper , better ones .	0
I was provided an Etronic 2 .1 Amp / 12W Dual USB Car Charger for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review , so this is what I found .What You Should Know Before You Buy9830 The charger is pretty small and only sticks out of your car 's charging outlet about an inch and a half .9830 Has two ports for a total of 2 .1A output a 1 .0A port and a 2 .1A port share the total output capacity .9830 Fast charging speeds when charging a single device , and slightly slower when sharing the 2 .1A output with two devices including an iPad .9830 Very compact for travel if you need to take a car charger with you on trips renting a car at your destination for example .Detailed Review9830 Look I received a sample product that did not come in a retail package , so I can not comment on the packaging or if it normally includes an instruction manual . I only received the car charger . It is a clean white car charger with a blue company logo on the top and two USB ports on the front . The two USB ports are very faintly marked as a 1 .0A port and a 2 .1A port , but share the 2 .1A total capacity . It also has an LED power indicator light on the front . It looks nice and small and it appears to have a very nice build quality .9830 Installation As with any car charger , you basically just plug the unit into you car 's charging outlet . It had a nice , tight fit and easily maintained the connection to the charging outlet . It only stuck out about an inch and a half . The white color matched my Apple Lightning cable , but just make sure the white color works for you .9830 Use and Performance Once installed , I did some basic tests to see how the Etronic car charger handles various charging situations . During my work commute , I took my iPhone 5 that had 30 charge remaining and I did a stand alone test using both ports for 10 minutes each . Both ports increased the charge on my phone by 10 in ten minutes or 1 per minute . I was even streaming music to my car and received a call during charging , so charging performance was very good . I then tried out the charging of my iPad 2 in the 2 .1A port that is built for tablet type devices and the iPad indicated immediately that it was able to charge with the Etronic car charger and had no problem charging up . When charging both devices , it was n't as fast as some 3 .1A total output dual USB car chargers because it shares the 2 .1A total capacity , but it did a fine job for the low price .ConclusionOverall , this is a nice 2 .1A Dual USB Car Charger . It is pretty small and has a nice quality build . The unit looks great and performs very well . If you are looking for a reasonably priced dual port USB car charger that has fast standalone charging speeds and works well with an iPad , this charger is worth consideration .	1
the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now	0
You can not go wrong with this cover . It fits with a snap , kickstand is great , iif you want to put it down and use it standing up straight or laying up on its side . For the price of this cover , you even get the holster part with a clip , that your phone slides into , for extra protection . This seller got it to me very quickly , 4 days before it would have been past the date . Highly recommend this cover .	1

I do n't care for the taste of mushrooms but know they are good for health , so I prefer to take them via capsule . I have been taking the Immunity mushrooms for about a year now and I do n't get colds and the flu as often as I did before and I also appreciate the savings of buying through Amazon . I 'm pretty happy with this product .	1
I was skeptical from reading other comments about how the battery was going to work . It arrived right on time and in great condition . It was completely drained out . I put it in my phone and started charging . Did fine and works great now ! Still I am not sure whether it works better lasts longer than my original battery but I have so far used it once . It 's original . . .	1

These SmithNephew SkinPrep Wipes are very effective at protecting sensitive skin from repetitive tape bandaging . I have very sensitive skin and , due to a chronic condition , have needed bandaging on several areas of my body for over a year now . Before using this regularly , I would periodically get a reaction from the adhesive or ripping when removing the tape .Applying this to freshly cleaned skin and allowing it to thoroughly dry before bandaging works best .Highly Recommended ! I have also usedAllkare Protective Barrier Wipes Box of 100 by Convatec , which also works well .CFH	1
These batteries are definitely worth the money . The hold their charge very well over time , but also can be used in devices that use a lot of power . I bought these initially to replace rechargeable alkaline batteries which are no longer available . Now I have replaced all my AA , AAA , 9V , and D batteries with Tenergy Centuras . They have saved me a lot of money since I only have to recharge the batteries instead of continuously buying new ones . They are great for digital cameras , remotes , any anything you can think of .	1

I 've been through many clear screen protectors in that search for the perfect one . OK , well maybe not perfect but close to it . This protector falls well short of any expectations .It leaves your screen with the rainbow effect and that looks awful . It was a breeze for me to put on since I 've installed so many of these over the years on various phones , but still , this has got to be the worst of them all . Any screen protector that leaves behind a rainbow effect is not worth having on your phone .I would return this back to Amazon but at the price I paid for it , it 's not worth the hassle . Just stay away . Unless you like having that rainbow effect look on your screen . How did this get 5 stars ?	0
This product is not at all as described , but it does come packaged in a nice and colorful box . The eye catching box or package is about the only thing good I can say about the product . I am like several other reviewers that have said it not a pleasant intense , but the opposite , it does burn her and him . I would not recommend this particular gel by KY .	0

Long Beach BMW service department ! ! ! ! 8162017 we took our car 2002 m3 for a diagnose and a change oil if needed . . what they did is they did n't call us they change the freaking oil . and after they told us they need to replace the oil censor and needs to drain the oil again . If these people know what they 're doing they should have too it off first and diagnose instead of changing the oil and draining it .	0

Belkin Thermoplastic Polyurethane case for iPod 4 G is a nice addition to protecting the iPod investment . This is a flexible cover that has a ribbed back . It should make it much better and longer lasting than some of the plastic ones we have bought . The case will protect from scrapes and scratches and with the ribbed back make hand holding much better . This makes dropping the iPod less likely . Easy to install and well worth getting for iPod protection .	1

I bought this watch as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it . It rarely comes off her wrist . She is an optometrist and claims she gets compliments on her watch constantly . This watch along with others was on her Amazon wish list . I had a really hard time making the decision to buy this watch . I read every review and checked online reviews as well as EBay reviews . I also checked every possible source for prices . eBay had several auctions for different Michael Kors varieties including this one but the minimum always turned out to be at least 150 which matches the Amazon price . Amazon of course offers brand new watches and free shipping . The other thing I struggled with was buying a watch with a plastic band . That was a hard hurtle to get over but I am glad I did . The band is quality and looks very nice . Also I doubt there is anyway to achieve the color and tones without actual Ivory and I happen to be fond of elephants . I also like the other animals that have Ivory parts .	1

I bought these for my son 's birthday at the end of April . These strings started to give around the toe area about a month in . There is now a hole in the toe area and they are barely two months old . I just had to go out and buy a new pair . I have never had a problem with New Balance shoes . They have been my shoe of choice based on their durability . I think I got poor quality this time around .	0
What I received , was not an Allegra K piece . It was a cheap knock off . As always , when I order what I believe to be Allegra K , and receive an imitation , it never fits correctly . The sleeves are ALWAYS to tight for one thing , and the sizing is never accurate . I was truly disappointed to receive this . If it had been a TRUE Allegra K piece , it would have fit perfectly . The item I received did n't even have a tag . Allegra K , ALWAYS has the brand name tag in it , ALWAYS !	0
Worst car buying experience I have ever had . Just purchased a new Cadillac and as soon as the ink was dry on the contract everything went bad . I 'll list the items to make it quickerThe car was delivered in horrible shape with grease handprints on the doors , seats , and dash had to get the car detailed to fix itHad a couple small problems with the car speaker rattle and a rattle in the back no big deal , it happens . Took the car in to get fixed , they had it for 2 weeks with not one update . Had to call them to see what was going on at which time they said that they could not find any problems . Drove down to the dealership only yo find the car caked with dirt and a large grease stain on the driver 's seat where the plastic seat cover should have been . I got the service advisor in the car turned on the radio for 10 seconds and said do you hear that ? Then drove around the block , with the same result . I was notified a week later that the car was complete and let the know that I would be picking up the car in 2 hours and would they please have it clean and ready . When I got there to pick it up I could not believe my eyes . The car was now covered in 3 weeks of dirt and it seams in their hunt for the rattle they got grease on the seats , door panels , back seat release levers , dash and a very interesting boot print on the back of the driver 's seat . I called after leaving requesting a call from the manager to get an explanation of what had happened . Instead got a call at 830 at night from one of the managers who was not about to apologize and referenced that maybe I should not have brought in my car . The next day I received another call from the sales person who sold me the car and the sales manager apologizing but said there was nothing they can do to remedy the situation , the problems with the dealership or the expense of detailing the car over and over each time I picked it up . The Cadillac is a great car but the dealership it 's not even close to being equipped either with their facility or their customer service to have Cadillac as a lineRecommendation buy a Cadillac , anywhere but Marvin K .

BEWARE , BEWARE , BEWARE . I purchased a 2017 Toyota Camery on 8 / 4 / 17at full price . . The dealership changed the date until August 1 , 2017 . The White pearl Camery did not have the options that the first Camery I looked at . I was not aware of this because I never was given an opportunity to test drive this car . The dealership put on 210 miles on my new car . I was rushed into an office finish the deal on the care package of the car with Jason . I brought the car home first time to drive this car . I went through the book to find out this car had no options and was not going to meet my needs . I purchased the car for traveling yet it has no traveling anything in this car . 8 / 15 / 17 I brought the car back to dealership explaining that the car would not meet my needs . I put on 181 miles on this piece of junk running back and forth to the dealer because they charged me an additional10 . 00 on the paperwork . The manager of Serra Dealership threatened to call the police because I was upset they would not find a car that met my needs . I spent 27 , 033 . 57 on this peice of junk that does not meet my needs . I hope the owner of this company does not sleep well because he hirtes individuals who screw other people and that is how they make thier money . I would not trust an oil change at this dealership . I had to call my atorney whiler o was sitting in the show room . This is the first new car I ever purchased and do not thin I will buy another one , I have other dealers working with me but i DID MAKE SURE I TOLD THEM HOW I WAS TREATED BY SERRA OF TRAVERSE CITY . I WILL GLADLY GO BACK TO BILL MARSH .	0

Based on all of the reviews , I had to try this . I have really bad lower back pains and my posture hips are slightly misaligned . After reading the directions and trying this several times , I do n't feel it helping my lower back . I tried tightening the belt tighter but it still lacked the support I was expecting and want . I will continue to try this a little more . If I find that it does work , I 'll update my review .	0

So many positive reviews on this , I actually thought it might be a good idea to take . . Why did n't I read the negative ones ? An upset stomach is the best of the awful symptoms taking this has given me . Talked to a friend of mine who is a pharmacist and she told me to stop immediately because it can seriously hurt you . Thank god I did before it got worse . Please do not buy this or let anyone you know take these !	0
Very nice size , weight and craftsmanship make this an excellent gift . The chain is a bit dainty , but fine for a woman . There is an abundance of celtic / garnet jewelry in Amazon , so it was simple to match this with a bracelet and earrings .

A bunch of idiots work here . . my boyfriend was looking for a car last year , he ended up turning his in and got a new car . . the man that helped us was very nice . . until my boyfriend 's second oil change . . . upon getting the care one of the reasons we got the car was the FREE oil changes and tire rotations for 3 years . . myself and my father are witnesses and heard this from the guy that sold us the car . . took his car in yesterday and the idiots here told him they have nothing on file for him stating that he get 's free oil changes . . BULLSHIT ! They also could not find any record of his first oil change with them . . are you joking me ? I just recently had a death in the family and i am beyond pissed that i have to deal with this nonsense because their staff is incompetent ! SO FURIOUS ! my boyfriend 's name is EDWARD SHORTIS BY THE WAY . We are just so turned off by this experience , to make matters worse they told him that if he could provide them with documentation stating that this was true they would honor it . . sadly my boyfriend couldn'tt find anything . . i mean who would think to ask for that in writing from a dealership ? they give you all the papers and you just assume this would never be an issue . . what a joke . I 'm writing a letter to the attorney general about this . . My boyfriend is so angry we will be looking for another vehicle at another dealership and getting rid of the Nissan .	0
First of all , the sales person that sold us the car was excellent . But the service afterwards has been terrible . It 's been more than 3 months since we got a used X5 and we still have n't received the tags . I 've been stopped twice by police officers and have n't been able to register my car on the fast track I use to commute everyday . I have called several times and do n't get a straight answer or I 'm just transferred to a voicemail which never calls back . . . I will probably never purchase a car from this dealership again . . .	0
I bought this as a wedding band , and it was so painful to wear I had to change rings . It has two things working against it . . .first , Tungsten Carbide is extremely heavy , and secondly it is one of the hardest substances used in jewelry . Combine those two attributes and this makes for one of the most uncomfortable rings to wear , especially every day . Now , if you are buying this to wear occasionally , it might be bearable , because the ring does look good , does n't scratch , and is a wide ring . But because of its size , this will constantly hit and rub the neighboring fingers , and with the weight it made my ring finger constantly sore . I actually thought I would get used to it and eventually it would not be painful , but after 9 months I gave up . On a positive note , Ozeri was the seller and they were very helpful and a pleasure to buy from . . .they even sent me a second ring at no cost , in a different size , as a courtesy I did n't ask for it , they just offered . I wish this would have been more comfortable because it does look good . . .just not worth the pain !	0

Daniel Nino is truly the best salesman , hands down . I 've been buying cars from him for years . He 's like family now . When I have a problem he takes care of it quick , fast and in a hurry because he makes it his problem and his priority . He looks out for his customers and their well being . How many people can say that about their salesman ? If you 're looking to buy a new or used car go to Rogers Auto Group and ask for Daniel Nino . You wo n't be disappointed .	1

I do not understand how anyone could like these . First off , they are very heavy , so if your feet are sore , who wants to hang beanbags on them ? Then , you put them in for 30 seconds , and they start to smell horribly of linseed . Check them , they do n't feel any warmer then they did when you put them in . Try another 15 seconds . . . .they come to about room temp . Let them cool wo n't take long ! and try again . . .they do n't feel warm , so try putting them on . They just DO NOT HEAT UP . . . .these are worthless , I am returning them	0

I have tried numerous brands and styles for running and challenging step classes with interval training that includes lots of jumping and lateral moves . These are by far some of my favorites over the years . I do n't run more than 4 miles or so as a reference . The color is vivid and fun if you like that . I have the black ones as well . Excellent fit and support for my higher than average arches and narrower than average feet . I like them so much I am considering a 3rd pair to keep when the others wear out because this style is already discontinued .	1

I have bought many socks through the years . These are incredibly cute , but after only about a dozen wears the heels already have holes . That is simply not acceptable , especially at the price they cost . The shoes worn with them are worn with all of my other socks , some of which are years old with a great many times more wearings .So , if you want to remove the ankle portions and hem them for a different use then you may get reasonable value from these socks , but if you expect to wear them as socks in a normal fashion then unless you can throw money away these are not the sock for you .It 's quite a shame really because they are truly cute but I suspect someone decided to save money on the fabric quality .Socks Polka Dot LeopardDenim	0

Was really excited about getting this phone / wallet . . . . .What a dissappointment ! It is hard plastic and the studs are more like spikes ! ! It actually hurts your hand to hold it ! ! I paid more for this phone / wallet cover than I did for the last 3 and this one is the poorest quality ! I would warn anyone NOT to order this . . .You will regret it ! !	0

This product is a great concept , however . . . I found that it leaves white residue on your clothes . The residue is a waxy white residue like a bar of soap or white crayon mark . Sometimes the residue is hard to spot , but it happened each time I used this product . It happens more on clothes with rough fabric , like for example . . . a pair of jeans . I ca n't imagine that this problem only happens with my drier . I do have an older dryer that uses heat tumble cycle drying method . Obviously , I ca n't recommend a product that leaves white marks on your clothes . I hope they solve this problem though , because if they did . . . I would definitely buy a product like this that works well .	0

offers should no longer appear on the website if they 're expired . especially if they expired yesterday ! i was looking for croods ticket and saw the offer . bought a gift card and then read the offer expired yesterday ! being an online developer manager of a company website as well , i would n't have expected fandango to still be displaying an expired offer . shame on me for not reading the fine print .	0

I did n't buy this product thinking that it would actually put me to sleep , but rather that it would help me get into a more relaxed state so that I could get to sleep more easily , somewhat like aromatherapy . I used it in tandem with Bach 's Rescue Remedy Sleep , and I have to say that the two products worked together very well for me . The scent of Badger Sleep Balm is incredibly soothing and relaxing . I think what it really does is clear your mind so that a more relaxed , sleepconducive state of mind is achievable . However , I do not think it would help solve serious sleep problems .Based on this product , I would definitely like to try some of the other Badger Balm products . it 's a lovely , gentle natural product .	1

Anker Support 5 STARSReviewed Product 1 StarNew replacement product read my separate reviewhttp // www .amazon .com / gp / product / B00B8M4IMK / refs9psimhgwp107d0i1 ? pfrdmATVPDKIKX0DERpfrdscenter2pfrdr1J6S2WQ78SYSN66HSREJpfrdt101pfrdp1688200382pfrdi507846I was anticipating a nice charger based on the positive reviews on here but I was disappointed .Pros NoneCons1 . The USB plug 's surround is too thick , thicker than the S4 or Note 3 charger , that it catches the two cases I have when i try to plug it in . I will attach pic after I finish typing . . .2 . Though the cable can be stretched to make it longer , it is too hard and very stiff so I am sure with repeated use just like I want to use thing thing , it will eventually damage the usb port of my Note 3 .3 . The material used on the cable is soso , it feels like the cheap silicon phone cases on fleabay , I have a motorola car charger that glows when you plug it in , and the cable on that is very flexible but robust .I would much prefer the long straight cable than the telephone wire style cable of this charger . Goodbye Anker . . . . you are going back to where you came from . Thank you amazon .Edit April 22 , 2014I was contacted by Anker USA and they have sent me a replacement which is the Dual Port Rapid POWER iQ charger .I have to say this charger works great , it charges the phone as quick as the wall charger even when I am navigating with the Note 3 .The reviewed product remains 1 star , but the new replacement product I will review separately . And a 5 STAR for Anker support .	0
Love my car , 2yrs . old car but the only this I do n't really like is service dept . I called to see if I could bring my car in because battery died . Called Triple A diagnostic bad cell need to replace battery . Called Buick service I was turned away because they could n't accommodate did n't give me any reason the first time I called . So I called again and service dept already closed so I got the sales dept . I was told that they were repaiving the lot ? ! ? ! But they were still open . They just could n't take my car ! !	0

I loved this when I saw the picture . I was so looking forward to it 's arrival . It came with no tag . Allegra K ALWAYS has a tag . What I received was not even CLOSE to the image . I would have to have pencils for arms , in order for the sleeves to fit me . Allegra K ALWAYS fits me . There are several sellers on Amazon who are advertising an Allegra K item , with absolutely no intention of shipping Allegra K . Make sure when you order the item , the seller IS going to send Allegra K . I was VERY disappointed !	0

the site is not good , it does not have a good customer call number and this is not the first time i had to cancel a movie ticket that was purchased on my card instead of my gift card . to order movie tickets online , instead of the box office is a waste of time . i have to hold over 20 minutes to cancel a transaction and still holding . . that is not good customer service .	0
a few weeks ago , it was my sisters birthday . i always use fandango for show times and to purchase tickets . the show times on fandango were wrong . after getting ready and getting her excited to see a new show , the movie theater had closed an hour earlier . i find this unbelievable that the only use fandango has for me are movie times and tickets and it can not offer me that . we got to the theater and there was a security by the door saying i 'm sorry fandango is incorrect you need to go to our website . . . along with other groups of angry customers ! ! ! i have an iphone , so as soon as i ask for movie show times my phone uses fandango . unfortunately . i need to know that i can trust this site .	0

This storage organizer is okay for wanting to organize your handbags but the actual storage spaces are too small for average and larger sized bags . When you spend between 300600 for your handbags you do n't want to have to crumple or fold your good leather bags so that they fit into these small and slender cubbies . I would not repurchase this product .	0

I purchased this item for myself so when I shop I do n't have to ask people to help me read ingredients on products . It works great ! While it makes a beautiful necklace when you are not using it , I love the fact that it is right there when you need it .

I recommend this for all women who need a little help seeing small print but do not want to wear glasses .	1

I leased my Rouge from this dealer in May , 2016 . The deal they advertised was they would buy me out of my existing lease if I leased a new car from them . I did the deal and gave them my old Volkswagen but they forgot to turn it in . Come October I 'm getting invoices from VW as the car was due to be turned in in September and Nissan said they would look into it . They say they had taken the car to their service department and forgot about it . In November they finally turned the car in and in January I got the final invoice . I sent it to them at least six times and they never answered me about paying the invoice . Now their showroom is empty and I am on the hook for 3 , 000 they were supposed to pay .	0
back in may of 2010 i had tickets that i bought off your website for the kenny chesny 3d movie . as it turned out i coud n't go to the showing due to the devastaing floods that occurred in nashville that exact same weekend . the movie theatre i was to go to was destroyed and closed for a year following the flood . i contacted fandango a month after the flood asking for a refund and was told that the movie theatre had to do it . of course seeing as the movie theatre was under water and remained so for a year , i could n't obtain a refund . is there anything that fandango can do regarding this ? i understand years have passed since this instance but when i was told by fandango they could n't do anything i just let it go and ate the money . but when i saw the letter from the president in my email box , it made me recall the situation and thought i 'd write . it was 3 tickets at 18 per ticket . seems to me these are extenuating circumstances and a refund would be easy to do or credit for future tickets .	0
Love this case ! It 's durable , holster securely holds my phone , and the kickstand is just a bonus . The case is nice and grippy thanks to the texture , making it easy to slide in and out of the holster . Great buy !	1

Got this as a gift for my mom and it is her favorite of the two aprons I purchased for her . Looks nice and neat and does not wrinkle because of the polyester and the pinstripes are cute . This is a good working apron for someone really working in the kitchen and is also a somewhat cute apron for those who want to have some stain coverage and still look smart . However it is poly so if you are looking for some adorable little thing to wear while you are handing out tastings to your guests you might want to take it up a notch . For what my mom needed it was perfect something that stands up to real work while still looking presentable for serving to her customers .	1
I really like using this product . I also like the all natural ingredients that it contains . I have tried using arnica jells and creams before with out too much success . The combination of ingredients in Penetrex seems to make it much more able to penetrate and get to the source of the pain . The cream rubs in very easily , is not greasy and has no lingering odor , and it does help with pain . I intend to always have some of this product on hand .	1

This wireless charging base is great ! I have bought three different brands and find this one to be superior over the others . It is a little thicker than other bases but seems to be a great deal sturdier . It has a soft grippy feel so is n't slick like some of the others . It is very sensitive and picks up signal easily . The base itself charges so I can unplug the base and take it with me for charging in places like my Son 's baseball games and at work without messing around with plugging it in . The small LED lights let you know if it is charging and how well it has charged . It also has a audible beep that is easy on the ears . Wireless charging is a little slower than the traditional way of charging but this charger is quicker than the two other wireless chargers that I have bought . A great accessory to have .	1

Excellent mount kit for your bike . Installation is super easy . The case for the phone is great and does n't give much bulk when they are inside your pockets .

The cool part is it comes with a poncho for your phone in case you ride when it drizzles .	1

This is my review of the new trent powerpak NT135 T 13000 mahI really have taken my time to review this product properly I spent a lot of time with charging the device and charging other devices from this i 've tried several things which are little bit more unique to what my needs are . but just so people understand that this battery pack is not just for charging devices but it can be used to operate USB powered devices too . I have used it to operate my foscan wireless IP camera remotely where I have wireless access just not power The camera ran almost 18 hours on this battery pack . I also used it to power my snap scan portable scanner which I have used for several days on the road . For the product I just can not say enough good things about this product how well it works how versatile it is I really ca n't find any drawbacks to having this battery pack it not only charges your iPhone at least five full times but I 've got several charges for of my iPad . I was hiking with my friends several of my friends have had their phones go dead while we were on the trail hike being that I had this battery pack and can charge more than one device at a time it was a lifesaver . There are always times of things you wish that the device Had as extras such as maybe a wire maintainer to be able to wrapup your wires for charging or maybe faster charging time but just having the simplicity of this battery pack I believe outweighs any of the other additions I have had several other battery packs which have much lower capacities but they are much smaller and easier to fit into the pocket but being that I wear cargo pants most of the time this fits in my cargo pants without a problem and with the added assurance of knowing that I can charge my device and several other devices without worrying about recharging the battery pack I believe that this is the best battery pack on the market .	1

I brought my 2013 BMW with 39k miles on it , in for service due to the ' increased steering module ' that kept popping up . making it very difficult to control it was just serviced under warranty in July of last year for the same exact issue . It causes the steering to lock up ! Pretty dangerous ! Especially with my two children in tow . They said and I have the paper work to prove it that it was completely fixed ! Now here we are 9k miles later and the exact issue is happening all over again ? ! I feel that it was all about money to them and their commissions over the well being and safety that they promise to you and your family is a safe car ! After this experience I 've learned they do n't care about their consumer or a happy / safe one at that . It 's just money and lies . I wo n't recommend your dealership or any other BMW . Terrible customer service . And the lies ! If it was FIXED right the first time less than 9 mos ago it should still be fixed ! So basically since it was under warranty the gentleman said they did n't need to get to it just yet ! Proving it needed a repair but they want to wait until that warranty runs out . Also I asked for a rental car ! And Mr . Pence said NO you 're not spending enough so appalled ! It was a 12001500 fix ! Also Mr . Pence held onto my car almost 3 days while it just sat there not being looked at . My time is valuable too ! And when you spend a good chunk on a car you expect caring employees that listen , and do n't make you feel belittled and like an idiot .	0
Please note this review is not intended for the entire BMW Irvine dealership , which is great , but a specific individual who treats his customers with such disrespect and aggression . I do nt understand how such a reputable dealership can have such an unprofessional employee . I had just purchased a certified preowned Alpina B7 from BMW of Irvine . I also paid the dealer for a full checkup and brand new replacement battery , so I drove off the lot thinking the car was safe . As it turns out , I could nt have been further from the truth , the car was faulty and all its electrical systems failed a day after I got the car back . I specially chose to take the car back to BMW Irvine due to its great reputation . Its one of the biggest BMW dealers in the area and known for great work and service , so I figured it would be the best place to take the car for repairs . After the car had been towed back to BMW Irvine , the dealer said that there were other things to fix . The total came up to 10 K , which BMW said they would take care of COMPLIMENTARY of the dealer since it was their responsibility for selling me a vehicle with problemsThe following day , I wrote a review on Yelp expression my frustration . Considering I had JUST purchased the car from an authorized dealer , paid for an inspection AND battery replacement , I was understandably pretty upset that the car which I had JUST purchased had shut down on me while driving and placed my family in danger . Right as I finished posting , I called the dealer requesting a loaner car and I was told that a loaner vehicle would be waiting for me once I got there . When I arrived , however , Justin Slogar was in a rage over the Yelp review . He shouted straight at my face , in the middle of the dealership , that he had gone extra miles to repair the car , even going on to threaten me because I had spammed him on Yelp . Then he refused to provide the loaner car that the dealer had agreed to and REFUSED to honor the complimentary repairs he had promised . He took back his words no more repair for me , even though the car he sold me had caused all the issues and put my family in danger , simply because I had written a Yelp review that stated the truth about this situation . He even told me to take a shuttle back . What a waste of my time , effort , and money at this dealership . Justin Slogars unprofessional behavior and aggressive attitude are absolutely reprehensible . What kind of person yells at his paying customers and public humiliates them simply for telling the TRUTH on a Yelp review ? I m disgusted by this treatment and by his attempts to deny responsibility for the situation by saying that the car was just old and had issues . A certified preowner dealer should NOT be selling cars that break down as soon as they drive off the lot . Not to mention , I feel tremendously insulted . No apology for selling me a faulty car and allowing me to drive off in unsafe conditions , putting mine and my passengers lives at risk ! Justin Slogars words hold no value and shows that his attitude is the exact reason customers badmouth BMW . Eventually , Slogar relented and paid for the repairs , which he had already promised to do before yelling at me and attempting to go back on his word . However , I am disappointed by the quality of the repairs , the terrible service , and his reprehensible behavior . Again , I strongly advise you do NOT trust or do business with Justin Slogar at BMW of Irvine . He shows absolutely no respect toward his own customers , and his aggressive , unprofessional behavior is inexcusable . I believe nobody deserves to be treated the way he treated me , especially as a paying customer . I demand a personal apology .	0

I will never buy gold from amazon again its the only time I have been disappointed by amazon	0

why when i bought tickets on your site was i not able to go to my seat when i arrived at the theater . no i was told to stand and wait while i waited for the attendant to print out more tickets or go stand in line at the box office to get tickets . i paid more for the fandango tickets too because of the convience fees ! ! ! i was really inconvienced i went to the palladio . theaters in folsom ca . can almost guarantee that i will either not use fandango or go to this theater in the future	0

This is the standby product which helps when the cold / flu season is here . Also , it is good for sleep when a headache will not go away by rubbing some on the temples . Putting some on the soles of the feet is supposed to help with sleeping , too . It is always at the side of my bed when an allergy headache threatens , too ! It is a must for every household .	1
over the last few years i have used fandago to find nearest theaters and sometimes purchase ticket . when i try to find a theater playing the movie i want to see , sometimes it says not found enter a different location . but what i really want to see is if there is no theater in my zip code playing the movie , please tell me where the nearest theater is in the world . i would travel across states to see some movies . it is frustrating that fandango wo n't tell me where the nearest theater is regardless of my zip code . maybe instead of prompting the user with enter a different location , also provide them with a link that says find nearest theater anywhere .	0

I do n't know how I got along without this product . It 's seriously the best lip balm I 've ever purchased , the consistency is almost like vaseline but better . I ca n't really describe it very well , it 's velvety smooth ! The pink tint is n't very pigmented so it 's very good for every day wear , it not only keeps my lips smooth it also seemed to have healed the chapped areas almost right away ! Love this product , I also have it in the tube form . Highly recommend !	1

Today , I received an awkwardly written email from Melissa Steffy , the General Manager , saying they have made some small changes since my last visit . As a result , one of the sales consultants you have worked with previously , Mohammed Mirazimi , is no longer employed by BMW of Boston . We at BMW of Boston , are committed to delivering the highest standards in client care . . . . Letting go of your 1 sales consultant is not a small change . Good riddance to Mohammad ! I had an awful experience buying my car from him . I felt tricked into buying a car that did n't have everything I wanted . Shocked to discover , the car did n't even have power seats . Was this my fault , maybe , but I felt pressured to buy on the spot . I found Mohammed to be dishonest and unethical and cares more about making his sales quotas and only focusing on selling inventory off the lot . My complaints where unheard and unaddressed by the general manager . I have found much better service at other nonHerb Chambers BMW dealers . I bet your ratings will improve since Mohammed 's departure .	0
I read all the great reviews and decided to buy this purse . When I got it , I was thrilled tons of pockets , great handle and strap , fits everything I need without bulk . GREAT ! Was going to put in a 5 star review but got caught up in other things .Three weeks later , I 'm regretting my purchase . I keep my phone Motorola Razr M , very lightweight in the back pocket , which rubs against my laptop bag when I 'm carrying both . The purse now has a hole in the leather where the corner of the phone is . . . the hole is wearing in from the outside . The phone has rounded corners , so it 's not the phone 's fault it 's simply the pressure of the purse against the laptop bag which is soft nylon .Sending back and finding something new .	0

Love the colour . Usual size 6 . Based on reviews I cautiously bought size 6 and they fit .Well done reviewers .Length perfect , slight adjustment around hips and thighs , I am talking 1 / 4 inch due to my body shape being off the chart , plus I am fussy slim hips , wobbly belly , lean legs , what can I say ? 5'4 135lbs . Not skinny or baggy , my type of jean . Very pleased .	1
it is impossible to get the time for the movie , jurassic world to plan my friday . why do n't you have the times up for your out of town customers ? that is very inefficient advertising . you really do n't give out the information you say you do . how can we plan ahead ? the last time i complained you said that you did your best to inform the public . you do n't . please change this . people from osceola would appreciate it . put it back in the okay buyers guide paper from clinton . we could always find the current and future times . very helpful .	0

show which times are sold out by putting a red slash through the time so you do n't have to click into it . that would be really helpful in picking a time . it takes too much effort for users to have to click in to each time to check availability . this would greatly streamline the proces .	0
BEWARE of this dealership . I went there with the hopes of purchasing a vehicle . The salesmen are very rude , and at times belligerent . I was very disappointed in the customer service . If you check the Better Business Bureau they have numerous complaints against them about selling problem vehicles . To sum it all up , they have incompetent staff selling problem vehicles . Do n't say you were not warned .	0

Horrible service departmentService department is horrible . Dropped off my car at 1145 for a routine oil change and to have a minor recall item taken care of . Total time needed was 12 hours , according to them . So I left the car and told them I 'd be back at 5 pm to pick it up , more than 5 hours later . According to them , that would be no problem . Arrived promptly at 5 pm . . . no car . Still up on the rack , no time estimate for completion . And , to add insult to injury , no one actually working on it because they decided to hold a staff meeting of all the service techs at 5 pm . So I sat around waiting for their meeting to end and then had to sit some more for the car to finally be finished . Again , this was for work THEY said would take 12 hours max . I 've been a loyal Hyundai driver for years , but I 'll never buy one from or get service done at Shawnee Mission Hyundai again .	0
I normally love WallFlower pants . However , this particular style just fits oddly / poorly . I bought the same size in these as I always buy in their jeans and these were not even close to fitting . Additionally they make the backside look just horrible . These are simply not made for any curves / hourglass figure . I returned them not even 24 hrs after receiving them .	0

I was fooled by their initial kindness , even so far as adding several dealer options . I requested the maximum legal tint when ordering the car , and they provided what I believed at the time to be an excellent job . Today I brought the car in for my 10k mile service and inspection . Not only did I fail inspection , but they reported it to the state . I now have a car that is decidedly less attractive than the one I paid for . I was going to be a long time customer , but they will never get another cent once my current lease is up .	0

I tried them all , Bamboo 's , Targus , Adonis . . . non of them can compare with this stylus . Except . . . I have one small complaint but it 's because I have big hands . I wish it were the length of a pen . Otherwise , you can not go wrong . Not to mention the pen is excellent to have when need it .	1

I 'll start by saying I have an older dishwasher and am not often overwhelmed by its results . I almost always have to 34rewash34 a few items that it was not able to adequately clean .Prior to getting the Finish I was using a store brand 34pod34 along with Seventh Generation liquid squirted into the prewash tray .My first test with the Finish was to use it without the prewash and next I used it with the prewash .Surprisingly , the load where I used prewash was the load where I had to do the most prewash . Since then I 've done 3 loads with no prewash and in the load I emptied yesterday , the only item I had to rewash from the bottom rack was a single spoon . However I had 8 cups / mugs from the top rack that needed to be rewashed . That is a slight improvement on the storebrand / prewash combo , where I usually had to prewash several bowls in addition to the cups / mugs .However , I will say that what is clean is REALLY clean . It gleams and shines in the light , it is so dazzling ! I do think with a better dishwasher , I 'd be thrilled with this product which is why I am giving it a 5star rating .	1

This antiglare screen protector is perfect . It works so fine . It does n't leave fingerprints or anything like that on there .

This battery and case are exactly what the GS3 needed . Battery has a nice snug fit . Even better the tpu case actually has the holes cut out correctly and the buttons almost feel like there is no cover installed . The best is this battery is a beast . 7000 mAh seems to be true . I leave my gps on my wifi on my sync on my bluetooth on my screen brightness jacked up and drive around with the screen on all day using google maps . At the end of the day still have 75 battery . Incredible . I have used the hyperion batterys and while they are good they do nt hold a candle to this monster . This is a well deserved 5 star review .	1

Good grief ! I smell a very faint hint of lavender , but the smell of camphor and some kind of chemical smell is overwhelming . To make matters worse , I also ordered chamomile and it 's the same thing . . . lots of camphor and chemicals and a very slight smell of chamomile . I 've used essential oil for years and know what lavender and chamomile should smell like . These products are ridiculous and offensive will throw away and never order from this company again .	0

I 've purchased my share of cheap , crappy cases . From just 1 cent . Going to something I bought 27 it 's on sale now , I believe , it was like getting gold in the mail . At first , I was a little skeptical as to how a case could have a screen protector implemented into it . However , slipping this case on was so easy and the screen protector included has NONE of the issues like bubbles or anything like any other screen protector . Fingerprints are NO issue , with previous protectors I 've gotten fingerprints so annoying that you can barely read the screen this one really does the job . And you do n't even have to worry about dust getting under it since the protector is part of the case ! The back cutout of the case is nice , it shows off the Apple logo proudly I also found that the camera and light sensor cutouts were strongly reinforced . The power and volume buttons are easier to press than without a case a HUGE plus considering most of the cases I 've encountered require you to wrestle with the little silicone cover to turn the volume up . Lock and volume control button access is a breeze .And the home button is just my opinion , I might just be going crazy much more friendly . The iPod buttons were never as slick as the iPhone 4 's , but this case I swear makes home button access much easier .Another thing this case 's bulk is your friend . If you prefer tiny , light devices , then maybe this is n't for you but I never did like such an expensive thing being so thin and light . With this case when you hold it you get the perfect weighting so you really believe that your iPod is worth the 200400 you paid . The grips on the side make gaming and just holding it in general enjoyable even if you have sweaty palms . Yes , the outer shell is a silicone shell , but you will NOT get the annoying thing where you put it in your pocket and you have trouble getting it out or where hair or other dust particles collect on it This silicone must have been treated with magic since it has the antishock abilities of normal silicone but it behaves like plastic where nothing ever collects and getting it out of your pocket is like sliding a hot knife through butter .Although this is a great case , I only have a couple tiny complaints that is just me being OCDThe flaps take a little getting used to . When you charge or plug in headphones the flaps are raised up and the flaps are connected to the same silicone as the home button is on , so the home button case area sort of lifts up a little . No big deal , access is still easy . You just have to make sure you put the flaps back on when you 're not using the ports , or they will stick out and annoy you . I just had to make flapinserting a habit .Also , since the sides and top of the case surrounding the screen and the back part with the Apple logo are sort of raised , dust and stuff can collect but it 's easy to clean .All in all , this is probably the best case I 've ever encountered in my entire life . This being my first Otterbox , of course .Would highly recommend this product to ANYONE . Stop getting cheap cases and get a REAL case . It is more expensive , but hell , it 's SO worth it .	1

I am very disappointed . This is not a healthy drink . It says 100 calories but can says 160 but that 's least of my worries . Why red die number 3 ? contains caramel color why ? for strawberry n cream ? NO strawberries or flavor of a strawberries in ingredient list .I had this problem with th Zoic drink but wow not as bad and i was not expecting it . I drank one and the taste was not bad better than Boost or / and ensure my Dr wants me on or their puddings as my proteins low . I have mine in a new clean used once plastic cup with straw due to my disability . after done drinking maybe five minutes or so i take the straw and gently touch th sides of cup and wow tons of plastic a big handful thicker plastic and stronger than what we got with Chocolate zoic drinks . What is it gets in my lungs ? Please try this and see what happens but sit down we have never sen anything like it . Wish our camera was working I 'd post photos . I just want to cry i have been trying so hard to find healthy protein plus drinks for my health . It does say KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN .	0

This protein powder is DELICIOUS ! However , I have several issues that need to be addressed by the Jarrow Company .1 While surfing for price and product information I found this sentence regarding THIS product under warningsThis product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm .2 On the container it says . . . Keep out of the reach of children .So , let me get this straight .This company manufactures a delicious tasting plant protein , yet they think that consumers will IGNORE the caveats above ? Not me ! I knew something was wrong today when I arrived at my family 's Christmas brunch , and realized I was embarassingly gaseous . I drank this for breakfastCould it be the Xylitol ? Ugh ! And WHAT ingredient is so dangerous to children , that this product must be kept beyond their reach ? Is it the Erythritol ? Finally , do you have a DOG ? Do NOT share this beverage with your dog , as I did . My dog loved this stuff . However , XYLITOL causes hypoglycemia in dogs and elevates their liver enzymes associated with canine liver damage .Otherwise , tastes great .EDITJanuary 10 , 2012It 's taken me three weeks to figure out why my face broke out in a rash .I'm allergic to this stuff . And I do n't normally have allergies .I suspect it 's the Xylitol or Erythritol . . . too much of it , giving the product a very SWEET taste .So , . . . . rating goes down to ONE from 3 .There are plenty of other proteins on the market not full of crap .	0

Service mechanics are hacks . Have takin my brand new RZR xp1000 in for Polaris updates . Each time they have damaged my car . Twice it looked like they used hammers to beat my expensive Walker Evans shocks back into place . Beware of this service center . At the very least , inspect your ride carefully when picking it up . After sending photos of damage to service manager , I received no follow up . They seem not even to care that their ape mechanics beat your brand new 20 , 000 RZR together with a hammer .

I received three 3 M screen protectors to review the standard one , this antiglare one , and the privacy one . I started with the standard one , and really did n't care for it much . Then , I moved on to this one , and I actually very much like it .First , I guess I should say that I generally do n't care for screen protectors at all , as 1 . they rarely go on without getting tiny pieces of lint / dust under them , no matter how careful you are , and 2 . they do n't feel right . Some of them make the phone 's screen seem to stop responding correctly , or they feel filmy or streaky . The standard 3 M one felt a little streaky and seemed to have something on it that rubbed off after just a few hours of usage . Not horrible , but I did n't like it near enough to keep it on my phone .So then I moved on to this antiglare one , and I like it much better . As they mention in the description , it has a silky , kind of satin feel to it . When you look at it , it almost looks cloudy , though it does n't look that way when you turn the phone on . It does n't negatively affect the screen at all . And , despite my expectations , it actually feels very nice to use . They call it a smooth touch , and it does feel smooth . It does n't affect the screen 's performance at all that I can notice , and it actually does cut down on glare . I 've never noticed any particular glare on this or any other iPhone in the first place , but I must say that I notice a bit LESS of it with this protector on if that makes sense . That is , once I got this on my phone , I noticed that I can turn it any direction and I do n't see a glare with it . . .hadn't realized that I had made those tiny , subconscious adjustments previously , until I had this screen protector on and did n't have to make them .Your mileage may vary , but this screen protector actually has a chance of staying on my phone for a while . . .the first screen protector I 've ever said that about .	1
Update May 8 , 2012After having the unit for almost a year . I have returned the unit twice now . The first time the battery stopped charging after two month . The second time , there is something inside the left side of the unit that is moving around . the sound still works but something loose inside is making a lot of noise when I walk around or even just moving my head would cause it to make noise .Like I stated before . I 'm a heavy user , I use this unit about 5 days a week 6 hours a day sometime longer . If the unit wo n't last with extreme usage why should I pay 99 for it . they should at least withstand abuse because they advertized that it 's good for workouts , water resistance . . . . Heck , I should be their beta tester ! I got this unit August of this year 2011 . Listening to music on this headset via my Nokia N8 was very good however , when it comes to voice call . Nobody I talked to on my phone could hear me clearly even if I put the mic directly to my mouth .Battery life is about 5 1 / 2 hours . I use this unit practically everyday for around two months and now it wo n't hold a charge or rather it wo n't charge . Now , I got a dead unit . I plugged it via the USB on two different computers and the charging light does n't even come on .I know it 's still under warranty but come on , two months and it 's dead ? I mean for a unit that is a hundred dollars you should at least think that it will last over a year but I guess it 's not meant to be used everyday for about 6 hours a day . It can handle sweat without any problems but just do n't use it everyday eh ? Basically it 's meant for listening to music and no voice call ! Update . . . .I had to send the unit to the manufacturer for an exchange and their service or lack there of is really bad . I 'm not going to get a replacement till another two weeks . I would have paid an express exchange just to get the unit faster . Their response time is very bad . I get an email in the morning and I would reply back to the email as soon as I receive it but would not get a response till the next day that is if I get one .It might look petty but the unit breaking down in two months and it cost this much without any AC charger . I really use a Bluetooth headset almost daily and having w / o one for two weeks it bad . With this type of service I would not buy or even recommend this brand .Again I have to emphasize , the voice calls on this unit is one of the worst I have ever had and I have had a lot of Bluetooth headsets prior to owning this one .	0
This diffuser 's bottle is small , about 1 inch thick , and about 3 inches tall minus the reeds . The only minus would be that the wooden lid does n't fit on the bottle , it 's just decoration . But the small size makes it easy to place in small spaces , and the Cranberry Pear scent is nice . . . and it would n't be my first choice of fragrances .The best part is that there is this corner of my room where there has always been this stale odor , ever since I shampooed the life out of it to get rid of some cat urine stains . Ever since I placed this little thing on that side of the room on my nightstand , I do n't smell the stale odor anymore .I have had it for a week or two , and it is still pretty much full . . . so I ca n't tell how long it will last but so far , so good .If you have an area of your home that is prone to ambient odors , I 'd say it 's worth a shot .	1

This is the absolute worst Lexus dealership I 've ever been to . I 've had a Lexus for over 8 years and I have always had exceptional customer service until I came here to Fresno . Their service department sucks ! ! No one here really gives a shit and it 's highly demonstrated in their attitude . I would put people on blast but no one bothered to introduce themselves . If this had been my first experience with Lexus I would have never , ever considered purchasing one . These people all need to go to customer service school or be fired and replaced with people who actually care about their customers . It 's so unfortunate that this is the only Lexus dealership in Fresno .	0
this fandango website is fine but major problems with your schick movie promotions website . i had codes that were accepted and it took over two months to finally get the codes i was promised . i have friends who have also not received their codes . when marketing offers are made in conjunction with other companies and they are not executed well it reflects poorly on both companies .	0
I had an anti smudge cover on my phone prior to this one and I can definitely say it really detracts from the point of having a phone with an HD screen . This gives everything that you would need in a cover . Took me one cover to get the installation right but when you follow the instructions it works very well . I would have liked to see it covering more of the phone but realize it would interfere with cases . All in all definitely recommend this cover .	1

Nothing against Motherlove , my wife has been using their More Milk Plus capsules for months and it worked well for us . However , we decided to try these to see if it would increase my wife 's milk supply to a point where we would n't need to supplement with formula well , it nearly doubled her milk supply but it also caused severe eczema on our sons face and severe allergic reactions throughout our sons body .Buying these supplements has been my biggest regret so far . . . I strongly urge you to stop using these pills if you notice anything odd with your child when you nurse them .	0

I switched from regular deodorants to the natural ones because we shifted all of our products we eat and use in that direction . Regular deodorants never made me break out or caused burning , but this one was bad . It burned pretty bad for almost an hour , even after washing it off with soap and water . My wife 's pits were left stained not her shirt , but her actual skin was stained and she had lots of small bumps .We are switching to Aubrey Organics deodorant , and we might try Weleda as well .

If you go for more than twenty minutes , we ussually go at least an hour , this makes the penis so numb that it actually tingles and itches it gets so numb it hurts . I would say they went overboard on these . It is almost impossible to keep it up with these because it hurts . Not to mention that the man will be numb for the next hour or two .

Some guys buy corvettes and such as a ' midlife'crisis I decided I want to get in the condition I was in when I was in the Army . The fitbit is a great tool to motivate me , help me keep track of my progress , and more .The dashboard is an awesome tool , and the ability to add data like what I 've eaten , track weighins , and other information helps me gauge my progress . There is a premium version of the dashboard I think they charge 50 a year have n't decided if the free version is good enough for my needs .The unit comes with a dongle to synch with my computer , a clip to carry the one on my waistband or belt , and a wristband to keep track of my sleep patterns . There is an app , but it requires a ' low frequency ' bluetooth phone so if this is a 34must have34 for you , make sure your phone satisfies the ability to constantly synch up . Frankly , the dongle and the laptop work just fine for me .The one is easy to set up , easy to use , and seemingly very accurate . I find myself checking my daily progress throughout the day and actually have started parking farther out and look forward to using stairs since I got it .I believe this will be a useful tool in achieving my goal of once again being in ' fighting trim ' .	1

The plain simple is Penetrex works . It really , honestly , genuinely works . Sure , some injuries and aches may take more than one application , but one of the beauties of Penetrex is it layers , working better as you use moreif you even need more than one application in the first place . Since back surgery , I use Penetrex to ease muscle spasms every once in a while , my SI joint becomes inflamed , which Charlie horses the area , so Hubby massages Penetrex around the bones , tendons and ligaments to relax knots and after a traumatic knee injury , Hubby 's knee and scar throb , IT band stiffens and hip aches , but Penetrex relieves the pain in all three areas . It 's not a narcotic , and it helps enough that we continue buying bottle after bottle , relaxes muscles enough that it 's our goto topical analgesic . It applies like a dream , emolliiently and smootly , yet it has an unoffensive , even pleasant fragrance . It absorbs quickly , leaving the patient more comfortable .

I did not notice a decrease in cravings , but an increase in cravings . I 'm thinking that I am the exception however because most reviewers have had pleasant results . What has helped me tremendously are the chewing sticks . I use the one with tea tree oil . I 've also been using L theanine to prevent stress and this has completely wiped out my cravings . I keep jolly ranchers candy in my car , at my desk at work and in my purse . Something is working because I have very very little desire to smoke with the aids I 'm using . Sadly the tea did nothing for me .	0

went to fandango today to look for showtimes for local theaters . i was shocked to discover that one theater near my home , the bow tie cinemas movieland at boulevard square in richmond , va is no longer listed on fandango . this is a 17 screen theater complex , one of the newest in the metro area and the only one of two which sets aside several screens for independent and foreign films . it 's the theater i go to most often , so dropping its listing from fandango , only diminishes fandango 's usefulness to me . please restore movieland at boulevard square to fandango . thank you .	0

I just purchased a 2015 BMW x3 from this dealership . Working with Barry Frucht was a pleasure because there was no pressure . Barry was responsive to all my questions by text throughout the week before the purchase . I can be picky and noticed a couple of spots that needed additional touch up on the day of pickup and Barry made sure they were taken care of . He would n't let me take the car until I was totally satisfied . I was pleased with the tradein value I received for my SUV because Barry and the finance department worked with me to ensure I was satisfied . If you 're looking at a BMW , I highly recommend Barry Frucht at Leith BMW .	1

Got dooped by the reviews on how they 'd fit . This company needs to get their s together man . Mine showed up and first off they are a lot more cotton than they are poly . They look good I like the pocket placement . It appears as though the two snaps over where the Medic scissors on the photo are will break off in about 4 minutes . The biggest complaint however , and the reason I have to turn around and sell them , is that I wear my jeans in a 32 / 32 or 33 / 32 if I can find them . I got the 3135 size . The waist fits out of the package like a 33 , which is great . Unfortunately about 7 down on the top of the thigh / side of the crotch they fit like a 28 . It 's the strangest way they tapered them . The rest of the pant fits great , everywhere . The only reasolution would be to pull the belt line up above my belly button . . .which I assure you there is enough crotch slack to do . Dammit . Buying pants online is always such a bastard .	0
I 've tried others and this one works the best . I know many people have said they do n't like the fact that it ties in the back to keep the mask on your head but I tied the ribbons before microwaving it and then simply placed it over my head and it stays in place as it should . My eyes really benefit from using this mask twice a day . I highly recommend it .	1
Thin profile . Snug fit . I bought it for a few people at my company . I have used the CaseCrown for my iPhone 4S and loved it . Looks clean . Will catch pocket lint over time but the problem is the lint in your pocket , not the product .I used this in conjunction with a Skinomi cover . DON'T DO IT ! I failed with that . I would be careful if putting a screen protector as well . It slides onto the edges of the case and may snag your protective screen .	1

Ordering a pair of shoes from pictures alone is a risky business . These Rockport wingtips are a classic safe bet .The shoes look really nice , with good leather and clean holes and trimming . The opening for my foot is a nice surprise it is rolled off so there are no sharp edges to cut into my ankle . These have to be lightest leather dress shoe ever , more like the weight of a pair of running shoes than dress shoes .Rockport makes a nice solid shoe . They are n't Johnston and Murphy or Church 's perfection they are half the price and still look good . The shoes run fairly true to size , and are a medium width . They were immediately comfortable with no breaking in time .Overall , these are a good pair of nice looking shoes at a good price that feel like a pair of running shoes .	1

Fits well and offers a lot of protection for back and sides . Front screen will still need some sort of protection because this does not come with a screen protector .My last phone I did not have any sort of protection and it slipped off the dresser and landed flat on its back . The screen shattered . I decided at that point to get a protector for my new phone . I looked for an Otterbox solution but at the time there was none .Pros Cheap Durable Easy to installCons No front screen protector includedOverall the con is very minor and I really enjoy this case .	1

Well it works but I 've got ta tell ya , every time you take your iphone to the water is nerve wrecking , the case passed the test but I still somewhat do n't trust it , the outer build is rough , it can definitely stand to a good drop , the sleeper mic and earpiece are covered by some material that allows sound to flow nicely but stops water as dust , the front is a screen guard basically but it does stick out a little bit so you will have to tap a bit harder , gaming sucks with this , it 's still doable but will take some getting used to . The dock connection door closes nicely after every use with water I dry the phone and open the door at the bottom to see if any water got in , none so far but still . Good case however the whole screen guar at the front thig discourages me constantly , I feel as if it will slip out of place sometime , but again that 's just my paranoia .	1

Assembly was easy . The stool itself is wellpadded but not very sturdy . The hydraulic mechanism used to raise and lower the stool jams frequently . My niece and nephews love to spin around on it , so it does make an excellent children 's toy . Not that great of a place for adults to sit , however . I do not recommend this stool .	0

I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer , but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it . So I went with another Panasonic .My old Panasonic did n't hurt . Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle , cutting cleanly and quickly . Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter , not on the tip .This reviewed unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter , where they are TWISTED out of your skin . It hurts like crazy and I 'm highly pain tolerant . I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller . But it 's a totally ineffective compromise . It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit . Entertaining for my wife , yes , but this thing is no good . Not even worth returning this is hitting the trash can .	0
When you can buy a screen protector for 75 cents , why invest in a protector that costs several times that amount ? I 've tried cheaper protectors that claim to be optically clear , but are n't because they have an orange peel or uneven clarity in the material . Or they do n't fit precisely . Or they do n't hold up . The armor suit actually is crystal clear . The fit it extremely precise . And the wet application process results in better adhesion with fewer imperfections and bubbles . The Armorsuit definitely is the best of the 4 or so brands that I 've tried . I 'll go straight to this when I upgrade to the Galaxy S4 next year .The only tip or problem that I ran into during application is that it fits the screen so precisely that you have to be really careful to avoid even a tiny overlap of the edge of the screen . If that happens , a skin / case like the Diztronic case will lift or push the protector up and leave a bubble . So , make sure you fit it precisely while it 's still wet with solution . Otherwise , you have to peel it off and reapply it , which risks stretching , dust , fingerprints , etc .	1

So a while back I decided I wanted to buy a deodorant that was NOT also an antipersperant . No such luck . After searching through a couple stores , I just gave up . I have long used Sure brand deodorant and that was great and cheap . I 've recently tried Old Spice , which is also okay , but when I tried this Dove Men deodorant , I immediately decided to switch to it .A few major plus factors It smells nice but not too strong I hate strong smelling deodorant It is NOT an antipersperant It is clear no cakedon white stuff It has a very easy twist base to raise the deodorant unlike the horrible Old Spice designSo far there is nothing that I do n't like about it . Yes , it is more expensive than Sure , but given that it is everything I like in a deodorant , I guess that 's okay . Strongly recommended !	1

This was the worst Ice pack I ever used .

I wanted an ICE pack not a slightly cold pack that heats up as soon as it hits your body . Total waste of money , I returned it and just ate the shipping . I would not recommend this to anyone .	0

These Stylus are about 4 1 / 2 inches long and have a pocket clip . They have chrome trim on them and look very professional . They are lightweight , smooth and nice to the touch . They have a soft cushion tip that slide across my iPad screen well . I had a stylus before that liked to stick to my screen as I would try to swipe it but that 's not the case at all with these . They work well on my iPad because my iPad always responds to its touch without having to do things more than once .You can choose from a variety of different color themes including black , blue , pink , red or Andromeda which is a combination of black , white and silver . You will receive two of each color in this package which is what I picked . In addition to the six stylus that you will receive in this package you will also receive a cleaning cloth that can be used for screen cleaning . You will also receive 2 lanyards that are 12 inches long . They connect to two of your stylus and then the other end slides into the audio jack of your device . This keeps the stylus with you at all times and comes in handy . The price on these is quite excellent and I will definitely consider getting them again in the future . They would make a great and inexpensive stocking stuffer at Christmas . Why pay retail store prices or order some generic stylus that does n't work worth a darn in order to save money . With these stylus you can have a great stylus and at a great price . I have no complaints at all about them and I think they are quite good .Sample provided for review .	1

We stopped by Royal Kia on Speedway , approached by River offered us popcorn ! When he found out the car we wanted to see was at the Auto Mall , he offered to meet us . From that point on he worked for us to get the deal we wanted . He has a great people person attitude and although he was not at his ' home base ' dealership , he provided excellent customer service . We were Jim Click customers , in fact we went to see a car across the street but they forgot to get it to the dealership , their loss . We wanted to have our mechanic check it out and Royal Kia let us take if for a day no fuss , no problems . We purchased the vehicle and are very pleased . River made the experience enjoyable and I 'm sure we will return to him soon ! Also , River gave us a dozen red roses , how is that for the cherry on top ! Great job River , wish you continued success . Frances Frank	1

Initial call to schedule maintenance , was uncomfortable . And once there . while leaving service area , loaner was a quarter empty , lady refused to come verify for over a minute . I wrote down my cars mileage , came in handy now 846 miles later SINCE THE OIL WAS NOT CHANGED . And car told me to DO IT NOW . Cute forgetting sticker too . Think they 'd known just pushing reset oil would n't save them . Only 1 . 2 miles were added to my car 4 days later ' when done ' . Still having to wait for issue from list to be DONE once there . Customer service / friendliness not heard during this experience . The ending , having a young male driving car with door opened by his show on that scratches easy plastic , placing into PARK while still moving way to fast , messing up MY PERFECT tight transmission . Had any employee cared enough to WRITE DOWN , as I asked , please place emergency brake on before removing foot , after placed in park , , , , , , , why I 'm I bothering writing this , who 's going to believe a customer can . . . . . . . ' 14 Encore brakes STILL GO TO FLOOR WITH MINIMAL STOPPING or GRAB VERY QUICKLY , nose into dashboard , cause it 's to fast for seatbelt to assit . Smell of gasoline STILL and key only works one way / one side . But hey , when purchase new , with cash those big company 's got their profit . So now I 'm told to pay for oil change that YOU did n't do . It has recalls , think I can bring it to my closest dealer , AND TRUST they 'd get done . . . What 's CarFox going to read , dumb customer did n't have oil changed when due . . . . .

I have been a dedicated customer of Airport Chevrolet for years . My recent experiences have been extremely disappointing . Due to my schedule I took my car to another shop to have the oil changed to be told that my oil plug was stripped and I had to take it to a dealer . I was surprised as I had been taking my car to Airport Chevrolet . A . C . got me in right away and brushed off my concerns and even made a comment that , All they had to do was use plyers . Two hours later when my car was done and I was handed the invoice they told me , We replaced the oil plug for free . Eight days later my car is not running properly I took it to a different dealer to find out that my car was leaking coolant and oil ! Airport Chevrolet should have caught this in their inspection !	0
Belkin 's reputation for electronics accessories is not without warrant . There are many companies who sell screen protectors for phones , and this is particular Belkin product is now amongst quite a few competitors . Nonetheless , the product is admirable and performs as desired . This particular pack comes with THREE protectors , so make sure the number is what you actually want . They come with the standard peelaway back , so you need to be careful when applying the screen to make sure it is in line with the phone 's features .A useful inclusion with the product is a smoothing card not always something you see with a product like this . Basically , it is a hard piece of plastic with a flat edge that you use to remove air bubbles following application . As nice as it is that they include it , though , you can accomplish the same thing with a credit card or other household item very easily .I would caution any user of ANY screen such as this to be VERY careful about dust , dirt , and hand oils / products before applying . You really do not want to have a blotchy screen because you forgot to clean properly before application .	1

I originally posted a great review on this bag but i m editing this review because their is a flaw that ca n't be overlooked . The handles on the bag are attached to the bag backwards . Its really a big enough mistake where you have to be warned that the handles will not last long and do not sit right . Mine are starting to crack and I did not have the bag long at all . I ca nt find a link to contact the seller either , but i m still looking . And also each time you pick up the bag you have to adjust the handles because they twist from being on backwards . I have to say Buyers Beware ! Its a shame because the bag is pretty .	0

New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is the perfect place to really try out a deodorant for effectiveness . It 's hot , humid , and unrelenting in the temperature department from June to October every year . Often , deodorants abandon you by early afternoon , leaving you self conscious and worried about wetness and odor the remainder of the work day , and requiring an immediate shower and reapplication for evening activities . Not so with Secret 's Clinical Strength . I can be on the run all day , and switch clothing for the evening without worrying about wetness or odor ! Now . . .if they only came up with a product to manage sweaty hair ! This is a really great product , and despite a tendency towards allergies , I had no irritation or itching from this product either . In the shower , the residue washes off easily without the sensation of scrubbing off something gummy and gross like some other clinical strength deodorants leave you with . I 've recommended it to everyone I know ! It 's reliable , easy to use , easy to wash off , and the light scent is n't overpowering either .	1

I bought these based on the high reviews and people telling me Sorel makes quality products .When they were a few months old and only worn a handful of times , I laced them up , and one of the metal parts that holds the laces flew off . I returned to Sorel to obtain a warranty repair / replacement after talking to them .Several months later , Sorel sent me a completely different although nice pair of boots with no explanation . These were a dark chocolate / almost black color and a different style that did n't work for my needs . I called the company to inquire why I got a different pair and was told that these snow angel boots probably have a known issue with the lace holders flying off and that 's why they just sent a different pair . I told him I would like to know if this was definitely a known issue if not , I 'd like my original boots back . He said the manufacturing department kept these things secret and he would n't be able to tell me . I find this ridiculous . Worse , if they do send me a new pair of Snow Angels back and they have the same problem , my new repair / replacement would not be honored ! ! ! He did offer to let me pick something with a similar MSRP on the Sorel website , but there is nothing comparable I could probably find something if I were allowed to shop on Amazon , but Sorel 's listed prices are much higher for the same products .So I am left having to compromise and choosing between two styles I really do n't like or taking a gamble with a shoe that may or may not have a known defect .While they lasted , my feet were toasty and warm , but I expect my boots to last a lot longer than a few trips to the dog park . I bought these in late December and it 's pretty dry here then , and I used another pair of boots half the time when it did snow . By the time the spring snows hit in March , these were already broken .	0

The service department has issues with proper communication with its customers and fails to keep them in the loop when something may take way longer than initially guarenteed . I 've been waiting on a door handle for my car for close two months now April 13 . . . today is June 7 . I stopped by in person midMay to check the status and the service advisor said it was arriving that day . . sadly I think that was a lie to appease me because no one will call to set up an appt to install it and no one , including the service provider working the case , will return my call to even confirm the part is inhouse . bottom line it seems that getting my car fixed is not a priority to them because they are not making money on a part covered under warrenty . . the outstanding service plan that Hyundai provides is only as good as the service department that honors it . I 'm regretting that as a selling point . . hopefully this will get a call back since leaving a message on their machine is not effective .	0

Absolutely the worse service department we have ever had to deal with . We had a 2014 Pathfinder towed in on Wednesday morning . We were told that the fuel pump needed to be replaced and that they would have to order the part but that it would be in tomorrow and the car completed that afternoon . The next day we left two messages before finally getting a call back at 230pm to be told that the part did not come in and it would be here on Friday . I asked the service advisor to verify this which he said he had and that the car would be ready Friday . I asked him if he would be there Friday so I could speak with him and he said he would . Now it 's Friday 1130am . Still no call from the dealership so I called them . Big surprise no part and no service advisor or manager available to take my call . Our service advisor is not in today even though he assured me he would . Do not bring your vehicles here for service . They promise things that they can not fulfill , they do not call back and now we are left wondering how long is this repair actually going to take . No one there can answer what I think is a pretty simple question .	0

I LOVE the way Dove Clinical Protection works . I 've been using it for a few years , and would still be a happy customer today if the container was n't oozing a clear oily substance all the time .I started noticing the issue about a year ago , and thought it might just be a bad batch and just put a big paper towel under the container to sop up the oily mess . It was still a hassle because the oil would get on my hands when I twisted the dial , and it was nearly impossible to wash off .My next purchase resulted in the same problem , at that point I decided to contact Dove , a company that spends millions of dollars a year to tell us how much they care about their customers . I sent them the specifics of the problem , including lot and batch numbers from the two containers I had . I waited 3 weeks and had n't received a reply , so sent another email . No reply . Another 4 weeks and I sent a third email . It 's been 3 months and I have not received any reply at all other than the automatic we 've received your message and will be contacting you shortly .I've since switched to Secret Sport Clinical Protection , and it works just as well . I 've also switched all my other Dove items to different brands , how can I support a company that wo n't even reply to a simple question ?	0

After a year in one of their vehicles I have determined the suck at customer service ! They just want your money and try to deal with you at a distance .

I really with Sonic Automotive would come and revamp them !	0

I 'm more concerned with what 's in protein powder , but because they hype taste so much , I suppose I 'll write about that first .The taste really is that good . I have another name brand of regular chocolate , and this is even better . It tastes good in plain water too . I think the way they do that is by adding a little bit of dry milk powder , so that it both tastes good in water , and tastes a little more like ice cream . That 's my guess . However , because of the quality of the protein , there is still only three grams of sugar , which is usually lactose . Most higher quality protein concentrates have 3 grams of sugar , so this is quite a feat in my opinion . I also taste no bitterness from any artificial sweeteners , which I 'm extremely sensitive to , as far as taste .Since it tastes so good , it can be used in all sorts of nobake recipes that would call for chocolate flavor and it adds all of the nutrition , instead of just cocoa and sugar .There is a variety of proteins in here , in addition to fiber , MCT oil and other goodies . So this can practically be a low carb liquid breakfast without it being a ' weight gainer ' or meal replacement drink .There are some retired professional bodybuilders like Lee Labrada who have capitalized on their name and have started their own companies . Gaspari and Coleman being others . They are companies that have n't slapped their name on the products , like Arnold 's , but have been developed and tested with the high standards of the individual themselves . That appears to be the case here .This was a pleasure to use and I highly recommend it , if you can afford it .	1

When my mom broke her leg , the parents needed a wheelchair that they could easily get in and out of the car . I 'd gotten her a full wheelchair on amazon , but that was a 45 lb beast my dad was having trouble taking it up and down stairs . This was perfect , and meant that they could do things like grocery shopping without dislocating a shoulder or pulling a muscle . At 16 or so lbs , this provides mobility with ease . Combined with a great price and overnight shipping , it was a nobrainer . It also cost much less than the local leased one , considering she needed to be in it for over two months .	1

t took a week to negotiate a deal for a Sierra 2500HD . The sales person and his manager gave us a price , confirmed the details of the offer . We were pre qualified , negotiated the terms , and when we arrived at the dealership to pick up the car , we were told we had the price that we wanted but the cover we requested and confirmed that was part of the deal would be an extra 1700 . On top of it , Emmett would only say ' opps sorry . ' He told us if he had been involved sooner , he would not have committed to the deal ? The whole experience was a bait and switch . The sales person while very nice , the sales manager had no experience in negotiating a deal and therefore messed up and instead of recognizing this mistake , and making amends with their miscommunication we decided to walk away . This whole experience with this dealership should be a HUGE watch out for all consumers . They also told us because we were from Orange County they would not make any money on the service since we would not bring our vehicle over an hour away . If you are in the market for a car , I would stay clear of doing any business with them .	0
I love this because it lasts all day and has a nice but not over powerful smell . My son even likes it because it lasts when he plays most sports and he says it does n't make him smell like a girl .

As a person who teaches ethics , I can tell you this company , in my opinion , has none . This is the most dishonest dealership I have ever dealt with . I purchased a 2010 R1200RT from New Century BMW Motorcycles with a little over 23 , 300 miles last weekend . I found out after a few days that my bike required a 24 , 000 mile maintenance to be completed . I contacted Tico at New Century BMW Motorcycles , the person who sold me the motorcycle , to ask if he could have his manager contact BMW Motorcycles San Diego to work something out . Tico did not provide any assistance to facilitate that . I was quite disappointed in the integrity of this business and their practices . They stuck me with a 910 bill nearly immediately after purchasing and did n't bother telling me it was about to be due . Be extremely careful with them ! At BMW Motorcycle San Diego today , I was told they could n't believe that New Century BMW Motorcycles sold me this motorcycle without doing that 24 K service , and that they absolutely would have done the service with it being so close to being due . Even if New Century BMW Motorcycles would n't have done it , I would have expected that to be something they would have warned me about . I expect you would too , but they did not . If you ever consider purchasing from them , please watch out for their sly practices ! This was an absolutely terrible experience to buy a motorcycle for 9k and then to immediately have over 900 maintenance bill within one week of purchasing . If you want to be like me and pay more than 10 extra in unknown and undisclosed routine maintenance expenses within one week of purchasing a motorcycle from a dealership and have absolutely zero concern from the salesperson or dealership , then this might be your place . If you want to buy something where people treat you like a real person , I strongly recommend to go elsewhere .	0
The battery I received is not new . . .I thought I was buying a new battery but instead received a battery that is in no better condition than the one I am replacing . Now to be fair I went back and looked and it does n't actually say New in the description , but it does n't say Used either . The picture is of a new battery and describing it as Original leads people to believe they are receiving a new , original OEM replacement part . This is not the case . I called the customer service number and its an answering machine asking for your name , order number , and detailed description of why you are calling . I somehow get the feeling they get a lot of calls complaining about this so they use this as a screening method . This seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon . My recommendation . . .DO NOT , UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER !	0
I have called at least 4 times and left messages for the service department and no one has called me back ! ! They do n't even seem to pick up their phone .

Been looking for a used 6 speed manual Honda Accord for months . Seen many , but most were trashed . Left work and came to this dealership just before closing on Thursday night , saw an immaculate vehicle I like . Grey / Black ' 07 Honda Accord Coupe , 6speed manual . With my initial contact salesman gone for the day . Told them I 'd come back Friday after work to close the deal . Received email Friday morning showing that the ' manager ' was offering to hold the car until Saturday morning . Sent a signed buyers back to them late Friday night , with the intent of picking it up Saturday . I had insurance set up , certified check in hand , final inspection set Saturday morning . Got there Saturday morning to be told by the same manager that he had approved the deal to sell the car to someone else Friday evening before . closing . Now remember , I was offered the extension to complete the deal on Saturday morning , I initially told them in the email that I was coming in Friday night . A logical person , would perceive the extension offered was never legit , because had I gotten there Friday as intended . Another salesperson was being authorized to sell the vehicle to someone else . Logical , right ? The manager tried to imply that he ' thought ' I was not a serious buyer . Yet , within a minute later , said to me , ' both salespersons told him I was a serious buyer ' . The new term for such things is ' Trumpism ' . Tell them anything that comes to your mind the naive will believe , but when that does n't work admit the truth , but take no responsibility for it . I 've complained to Sonic Automotive , the corporate office , of this dealership . Why , because this should not happen to anyone . If you not going to hold it , then ' do n't offer it . Yes , I would have been fine if the offer was not made . Now , I 'm not going ' angry bird ' and say this will happen to you . But this is what happened to me and I 've got the emails to support it . So just ' think about that ' , when considering this dealership . Get it in writing , if you buy from them .	0
Terrible customer service ! Window is in perfect shape and is rolled down but will not come back up . So the car is driven directly to the dealership 35 minute trip . They call me the next morning and the window is shattered . They go on to tell me they have had to replace A LOT of window modules on KIA 's but they will not replace the broken window . Terrible customer service ! ! Update Gryder glass to replace window for 155 . All Star Kia lost a customer for life over 155 better check how much it costs you to gain a customer . Not smart . Regarding your response reimburse me for the window and then I can be a customer again . Do n't reimburse me for the window and there is no chance .

I tracked this order coming out of China and it took a while but I finally got it . It is a 2 amp charger just like the original and will charge my Note 2 in the same amount of time . . .about 2 .5 hours when the battery is completely drained . The only problem with the charger is the USB part that went into the phone . Mine was either bent or too small so I ended up using another mini usb cable to go into my phone . When I put the original usb into my phone I felt like I was going to break the input some how . Also , the usb cable seemed to be the same length as the original and not short like the other reviews stated . Maybe they changed the cable length .	1

After reading all the positive reviews for this product , I was delighted with the fitjust right in my usual size . But I am extremely disappointed that the soles are slippery in the pool .

I bought another top from this same merchant , and the sizing chart was off a size . . .too small . So whatever the chart says , get the next size up . I bought the next size up with this top , and it fit perfect . The style is very figureflattering . I wear this with black palazzo pants and heels , and use silver accent jewelry and sometimes a silver chain belt . I always get compliments when I wear it . I would recommend to hand wash . The elastic in the ruched sleeves is fragile and will develop little loose elastic strings if you 're too rough with it . But over all it is a great top for casual wear with jeans , or evening wear .	1

Pros It 's cute and light . My phone bill is cheap Virgin and I love the Android OS . BUT This is n't a review about a Virgin Plan or Androids , this is a review about a BAD PHONE .Cons It 's December , I purchased my 1st LG Optimus V from Best Buy in June . In October , I was out , the battery completely died , got home to charge it , would n't charged . Got another phone , a new one . Now it 's December , happened again . Also constantly crashes , freezes and apps disappear .Summary I 'm very unhappy .I do n't know how many of these 5 stars reviews have had their phones for more than 3 months or are not rating the phone based on its usability but the price , but this is unacceptable . I went to Best Buy , although they 're not suppose to replace phones they did I 'm suppose to send it to the factory and just be phoneless for a week . The problem was n't the battery , the phone completely lost its ability to turn back on even w / a new battery . Just terrible . TWICE .	0

This device does so much of what I wanted it to do and A LOT more . I was able to run a Sprint Airave and wireless bridge for well over 3 hours probably more like 4 or 5 but I was n't around when it actually died . Being able to connect any 12v and 9v devices to this is an amazing feature that comes in handy more than you would expect . The wall charger also charges extremely fast . What is most amazing about this device is that it is small and light for the amount of power that it actually packs . If you need a decent backup battery look no further than this one .	1

After all the great reviews I could n't wait to get a pair . I have actually never given a product less then 4 stars because I try to be nice , but honestly these are horrible . The fit is terrible and the look is so cheap , it would be embarassing to be seen wearing these . They wobbled on my foot . I am size 5 1 / 2 to size 6 depending on the the cut of the shoe . I got these in a six and the only reason I could get them on was because my foot is on the narrow side , but the back of my heel hung out a bit with thin sock . It was nearly impossible to adjust the cheap shinny plastic buckle for my instep . If you are used quality shoes like Dansko or Clark 's , do n't even bother to order . I kid you not , that these look like cheap plastic shoes purchased from the Dollar Store . For the price though not expensive you can do a lot better .	0

Southern Kia was the first place I went to look at new cars . I was interested in the Optima . We had two cars we wanted to trade in . They offered us 500 for each trade , which we thought was absolutely ridiculous . They did n't show us any numbers on paper , just what the monthly payment would be if we financed though them . They did n't want to offer more than 500 for our 2009 Malibu because it has 150 , 000 miles on it . Nothing wrong with the car , just high miles for the age of the car . The salesman told us that his manager was afraid to take the Malibu because of the mileage . He even went as far as offering to have his retired neighbor take over the payments on the Malibu while it remains in my fiances name . No way ! We went to Charles Barker Toyota and had an amazing experience . They gave us 4500 for both of our trades and we walked out of there with a better car for 30 a month less than what Kia was offering . My fianc is trading in his 2014 Kia Sorento after the new year just so we do n't have to look at the name Kia on any of our vehicles . We will be going to Charles Barker again for our next car .

These guys are dishonest and were rude to me on multiple occasions . Save your time , and go somewhere else . I tried three times to use a Hyundai Circle discount that Hyundai gave me , and each time they did not want to honor the discount . Eventually I gave up on Huffines and leased from another dealer , which resulted in me saving nearly 5k over the course of my 36mo lease term .

We found your staff to be friendly and genuine in our interactions . It would be helpful in the design process to have some sort of real time screen sharing sessions where ideas and be tried out and bounced back and forth . Waiting two business days for any changes to the logo was going to take too long to bring it to a finished product with all of the revisions that would have been necessary . Overall we found the designs came short of what we were looking for and pulled the plug because of the length of time it would have taken going back and forth to come up with something we were pleased with . We wo n't be using the design and are having to start from scratch .	0

The quality of the support staff is questionable .  Recently I have had tickets were the rep guessed as to the answer without doing any system research .  Reps close tickets without waiting for a response . As sometimes my staff is out .  I have paid services currently ongoing where the support staff working on my server transition does not follow up to questions or emails I send . When he encounters issues he does n't try to call but instead leaves emails , further delaying out a task that I have been trying to get scheduled . He rebooted a production server he was working on without asking me if it was ok . It has been two weeks since I have received a communication on status .

Having recently been forced into a change of job role and associated change of office location as a direct result of PLP I find DWPs statement of caring for it 's staff somewhat hollow and artificial . My work / life balance is now much poorer than it was prior to PLP - I am now out of the house for an additional 2 hours a day due to additional travel , and the office move will result in me taking a financial hit as additional travel costs are not fully reimbursed .

I was so grateful to have had the opportunity to hear this phenomenal speaker . This has opened my mind and given me a greater reason to get involved and fight for those around me . I have now set out to educate my family and my grandchildren schools . When my children were young I had such a hard time getting their teacher to see them in a positive light , to see them as people who were able to learn . Now that my children are grown they no longer want to live in Madison and my daughter says she has read that Madison is the worst place to educate and raise African American children . I will be trying to get this video shown in the school for not only my grandchildren but for all children . I believe that all children need to know that they can learn and that we want them to learn and be the very best person they can be . I left in tears because of my own experiences as a kid .	1
Absolutely everything went well from sales and design , to financing and warranty ! Our house is living great - the quality is excellent and we love the design . There is not one upgrade that we selected that we would not choose again . Any concerns we had were addressed immediately by Greg . The trades who dealt with our few warranty issues were on schedule and professional . We could not be more delighted with our new Shea home !	1

I honestly do n't know how his active ability even made it through testing ... one of the core mechanics of quake is weapon fire rate , damage , and dps . It makes the whole rhythm of combat flow well , each weapon has a balanced reload time and damage . Being able to effectively double your dps output is insanely overpowered compared to every other champions active ability . Blazkowicz 's ability needs to be changed altogether because inscreasing the firerate breaks Quake as a game . Abilities are fine in this modern new Quake game and they add something new and interesting to Quake , but something that redefines the very foundation of what an arena shooter is while also being very overpowered should nt exist . No ability should boost firerate like that .	0

I need to be able to export data from the system for PXT Select , and discovered AFTER the roll - out that this was not available . Following discussions and apparent study by Wiley there has been no communication regarding the ability to access data in the same way that I have been able to access PXT data for years . This makes no sense , and inhibits my interest in converting clients to the PXT Select or bringing in new clients , so I have focused my efforts on other parts of my business instead . I 'm paying a higher cost for the PXT Select and not getting the benefit .  Please let me know if there has been any movement in this area .	0

I have recently gone through a period of training having moved from CSA to CMS . The command in which I now work has imposed a working regime on me which is not condusive to consolidating the knowledge gained from training or allowing me to obtain the neccessary skills to perform my role adequately . From the outset productivity tagets were set and a requirement to be permanently available for inbound telephone calls has been imposed despite this being contrary to the wishes of the majority of the management team , being counter to the ability of individuals to produce productivity outcomes and alienating an entire training cohort who feel estranged from the rest of the command . I mention this as the situation I have explained is , in my opinion , likely to have an effect of my wellbeing and medium to long term health if the working environment I currently experience continues .	0

This game really does seem to echo that old Looking Glass Studios design / feel . Varying degrees of light and shadow , enemies curious and detecting anomalies or suspicious activity around them , and the like . The Action / Stealth genre has needed a really good kick in the pants as of late to be able to compete with most first person experiences . Having a slew of techniques such as displace and the spirit walk ability , seemed to exemplify an almost ethereal traversal from locale to locale , allowing one to make careful steps prior to pulling off a heist or objective . It 's a neat angle , one I certainly welcome so I do n't have to get caught in a slew of deaths trying to figure out what I should have done in a room . But I feel it syphons the essence of what makes this a true stealth game . Using the environment to your advantage is one thing , but I think I would have preferred more acrobatic feats , as opposed to teleporting and ghostwalking everywhere . Despite this , there are a plethora of options on traveling from place to place , or completing objectives . Throwing objects to throw off opponents is a nice touch , one most appreciated . Robbing people blind , also welcome , though it makes me yearn for a proper next - gen Thief title ( sorry Bethesda . ) Enemies were omnipresent , apparently . The minute I decapitated one in a CLOSED room , with no - one available to see it , when I sauntered over to the next area and was absolutely sure no one had seen me , I sheathed my weapon , and was still slaughtered by enemies . In any case , the game was a blast to interact with . I 'd try it again , but am currently unsure if I would pay full price for it .	0

Anytime I have called to check on a lens that is on backorder , I am always told they would have to call and check on it and it could take 24 to 48 hours for a response . This is not acceptable in my opinion . Also , on a few occasions I have requested an invoice thru the online portal . The invoice would usually be the one that is the original order date and not the invoice with the actual shipment and the cost of the lenses , if that makes sense . I get very frustrated with the overall experience when it comes to the customer service .	0

She has not taken the time to connect with us , get to know us and our history with the company thus far . I feel we are not treated as an equal with regards to thought partnership .

Improvement required in effective listening skills .	0
Rating is based on the issues and operability of the ES platform . The removal of provider entry and manageability from the pharmacy department to the IT departments is a significant hindrance to a successful daily work flow . This creates case delays , inadequate tracking and diversion possibilities . Creating kits in a pyxis is also extremely arduous , as the options to create a kit are pulled from the pharmacy formulary as a whole and not the actual pyxis inventory of items loaded .  Non - profile mode does not reconcile with orders to address unresolved wastes for a patient , even after an order is verified . This creates a diversion possibility .  The nuances of the system create significant disruption to daily workflow and increase the workflow at times .	0

Finding relevant information on uCern is sometimes difficult , as there can be information which dates back several years and may not be relevant any more .

We have had regular production issues with the integration between PagerDuty and StatusPage . Everything from Duplicate issues to missed updates . It does n't feel reliable at all .  I would like to see better coordination with PagerDuty , including :  - automatically picking up and messaging maintenances from PagerDuty , instead of requiring separate setup in SP .  - an option to broadcast comments from PagerDuty incidents out to StatusPage , so we can streamline the number of tools our ops folks have to work in .  Also , we would like to see an increased number of supported components per page . Modern tech stacks require a complex mix of MarTech partnerships , and our world is no different . We quickly exceeded what we can show on one page , however I am not a fan of requiring my customers to go to multiple pages to gauge platform status .

Since moving to Pyxis ES the support from BD has been very slow and has been unable to solve many of the issues we have . The answer is usually , that is being fixed in an update but there is no release for the update .  We just moved from Epic to Cerner and the Project Manager was out on surgery for months . BD decided to not assign any new project manager and had our Pyxis engineer fill in as project manager and engineer . That did n't work well and we are still sorting out Pyxis issues from our go live In October .  I used to be a big Pyxis fan and have worked with Pyxis for over 10 years .

1 . A brand new replacement workstation came with not a very large fixed disk , 511 GB , and I immediately have just 160 GB left after installing all my current applications and copying data . 1 TB would have been better .  2 . I requested help transferring my data from my old workstation to the new , but no help was provided . I used my department 's shared drive , and it took 4 days to transfer my data , whereas if someone spent just 15 minutes of their time to set up a network share - it would have only taken 3 - 4 hours to transfer the data .  3 .

Science Librarianship is diminishing . Researchers have become more self - reliant , or reliant on computers and search engines . Researchers rely on colleagues more than librarians . One particular service the library offers which seems to be the most appreciated is obtaining articles or books , etc . , materials that are not readily available at the home institution . The sciences have been better organized from earlier dates , and there are frequently just a handful of relevant databases which serve the disciplines . Engineering is more complex , deals with more varied resources . We do have to make ourselves more useful in creating & populating repositories , indexing , knowing resources beyond the university , analyzing resources , developing relevant collections , teaching efficient searching techniques and concepts , like citation searching . We still need to convey the value of subscription databases . GIS is becoming more important , along with other types of visualizations .	0

The response took too long to be received . My initial email was sent to the Help desk on Sept 21 , 2017 . I received a response to that email fairly quickly asking some additional questions about my issue . I responded with the additional details the same day . 5 days later I received another email from the Help desk asking for more card details , which I responded immediately . On Oct 3 , 2017 I sent a follow up email asking for a status on my request . I received a response the next day advising me that the issue was being looked into . On Dec 6th , 2017 I fianlly received a response with some possible reasons for the issue , but still no definitive reasons . At this point , the issue was n't as pressing for our client as they were able to work around it .

Confluence 's search is terrible .

This happens even when I type a near - exact match for the title of a page . I ca n't make heads or tails of why pages are ranked in a particular order . Evernote 's search , by contrast , usually ranks the page I 'm looking for at the top . I use both tools extensively .  A stop - gap measure would be the ability to turn off document searches by default . But really , the whole thing needs to be re - thought .	0

The cost was estimated by an aggressive female without any knowledge of the work involved and prior to design work being undertaken . All monies must be paid prior to work commencing so there is little chance of recovery of unspent funds and this form of business could be considered illegal . The cost to upgrade one existing cable crossing the road then laying a new cable 60 metres along the footpath was almost four times what it will cost me to have my electrician install 2 switchboards and 137 metres of cable on my property . Approximately 1.5 days for a subcontractor to excavate and lay conduit and one day for 4 truckloads of men watching each other talk and work does not constitute almost $ 32500.00 worth of value compared to the quote of approximately $ 8500 for the work on my property . Ergon could not operate financially without the monopoly it enjoys .	0

Strongly disagree with this statement . As a Gen - X woman , I want the organization that I work for and represent to see the long - term advantages of change rather than the short - term challenges . This means taking the time to develop a company culture that is flexible , adaptive , efficient , and diverse . I want to be inspired by those in leadership positions , inspired by those making critical decisions , and to feel like my ideas and performance matters . With my existing female leader and several other male department managers , I feel as though we have taken one step forward and 3 steps backwards this past year .	0
I really enjoy my day to work and I am lucky to work in a team that encourages creativity , collaboration and celebrates diverse thinking . Jen and Caroline have been tremendous leaders especially during this restructure . However , during this process we and the rest of the CEM team feel that the HR process has been so disrespectful of the wonderful contributions that we have made to Uniting . Whilst Jen and Caroline have remained poised and professional throughout this ordeal , we are now losing good people because of the decisions that Kathryn has made and the disrespectful behavior that Jill has demonstrated to all of us . There has been very little communication , a lack of transparency and decisions have been made based off ego and not what is right for Uniting . I hope that this experience will lead to the Executive team living up to the values of Uniting . Sadly , this has not been the case so far . The behavior of the Executive must be to live and demonstrate our values of respect and compassion and to treat people with dignity at all times . I 'm embarrassed to see how people have been treated by HR through this process .	0

There was a time when Levis jeans were the only brand of jeans I wore , but over the past several years you no longer make 100 % cotton jeans . I understand that styles change but it would be nice if you kept at least a couple of styles in 100 % cotton , my style was the 550 relaxed fit tapered leg which is no longer available either . I have read several reviews on your product since the change and I know I am not alone in my disappointment . I have recently found Lee jeans in 100 % cotton so I guess I will be purchasing those .  Also , it is difficult to find any of your styles in plus sizes . In case you did n't know full figured women like to wear jeans too .  I am sure my comments will fall on deaf ears because from what I have seen you do not listen to what your customers want in your product but I just had to share my thoughts and feelings .

This installation did not go well from the start because of wiring errors made by the installers . This meant that the Heat Pump had to be re - registered 6 months after the start and Ofgem had to make an estimate of the power used by the Heat pump . So the programme is running effectively six months behind schedule but the schedule has been extended by six months . The Sontex meter is not that straightforward as their are 5 possible readings so once you have identified the correct Kilowatts then it works well with the Elster meter which only has one reading .	0

Holiday time the wait in Anthro is very long . It seems to be the case in all Anthro stores and I ca n't figure out why .

There was a very specific model and color that I was looking for . They found it and brought it in so I could see it . They then waited close to a month while I organized payment . They then delivered it to my home with no charge .

- BD Super User Trainer ( Megan Maloney ) allegedly made inappropriate comments in the presence of Kaiser staff .

As the customer this segregation of duties has , at multiple times with each project , caused issues . It is the teams request that BD explore ways of closing this gap .	0

I have purchased three mattress toppers from overstck.com totaling almost $ 1200.00 . Through some warehouse error I received a fourth mattress topper worth 486.00 before tax . I wanted to do the right thing and return this item to overstock . I spent time on the phone trying to con vence the rep that it was an error , I could have just kept it and I wanted to return it to overstock . Finally he agreed to issue a pickup with ups . He thanked me . The next day I had to haul this large package outside , cover it to protect it from possible rainy weather and make sure ups came . A thanks is nice but I started to think about my efforts and the money I have spent with overstock.com . You would think that I would have been offered a thank you incentive of a 20 - 25 % discount on my next order since you offer regular discounts of 10 - 15 % to everyone . Just saying !	0

The study planning function is overbearing and difficult to personalize . It will not let me set both the study hours + exam date that I want , only letting me change one while it forces a change on the other . Because the automatic study planner does n't take into account activities other than the bite - sized lessons , this creates an extremely unrealistic study schedule . It then proceeds to yell at me about a schedule I ca n't realistically follow .  Additionally , the system only counts a section as ' done ' if I pass its assessment . It also makes an assessment the first task of the overall section , which I obviously do not pass because I have YET TO STUDY THE SECTION . Because I have n't passed that assessment , every time I log into the system to study , I get large , angry , red letters yelling at me that I have assignments past - due , even though I have DONE THEM .  Often the assessments at the end of sections will contain questions about subjects that were mentioned NOWHERE in the section , not in book nor video nor flashcards nor notes . The book itself is oddly organized and not at all clear where one section ends and another begins . I can often only figure it out by comparing the LOS from the bite - sized lesson online with the LOS listed in the book . Text and graphic design exist for this reason , so that people learning can be communicated to more clearly by those teaching them .  The instructor videos are helpful . The large test bank is a must . But the study planning system and the disorganized textbook are not great .	0

"Why is so confusing to try to navigate through RSAM and EURC to get added to something . The hours I have wasted trying to add someone to a LAN group are unacceptable . Trying to get the correct access to PPL was unbelievable , I finally had a great person walk me through this process but it took days to get through submitting the wrong requests . These request processes are designed to waste your time . There is no supporting literature written at a layman 's level , no contacts are provided to explain why a request was rejected . Those of us who require complicated access are frustrated . Why not assign a "" fighter pilot group "" that can help those with complex requests navigate through this ? I have seen developers blocked from delivering valuable software because they ca n't figure out how to get access . It has become a morale problem , developers are complaining to me that Chase internal systems are broken ."	0

EURC , RSAM , iBid , ePhurchase , Approval Central . Why not consolidate all of these into one consistent system . Right now it is difficult to know what has been transitioned to what request system . And why not make the approval process consistent across all request systems if we must have separate request tools . As for Approval Central ( smartApproval ) if that is to be the centralized approval arm to be used why not make everything go through it ? i.e. RSAM , iBID , ePurchase , ect ..  Symphony implementation lacks some core features and feels like somewhat of a tactical solution . There is no way to initiate a screen share , it does not integrate with the phone and updating your status based on phone activity , nor does it integrate with Outlook calendar . At least not as far as I can tell .	0

The answers to quite a lot of these questions would have been very different around 2 - 5 years ago when under a line manager ( Team Leader ) who made me anxious , where at times I felt bullied and often seemed to be singled out for harsher treatment with comments in team meetings and in one to one meetings made to feel I was n't doing enough . A change of Team Leader a couple of years ago was a step change in how I felt about my work , the job and my general health and wellbeing . My approach to work , the stats show my quality of output and I believe also my concentration on throughput has not substantially changed , yet I am perceived so differently by my Team Leader now . I am subsequently happier at work and mentally healthier outside work ( less stressed or anxious ) . The biggest factor in my health and wellbeing has always been the behaviors and actions of my Team Leaders .	1

While you deliver a product that is successful , there are many competitors , whether it is in gravimetrics , robotic preparation or photo capture , you are beginning to be outmatched by competitors . Updating your interface is a great first step , however there is little flexibility in the current deployment . I would recommend creating and installing an interface intermediary engine between the receipt of a message to DoseEdge and the input of the data into the database . Give access to this to your customers , provider wider system access for flagging , etc . to customers , and provide more customization to us who use your system . Additionally Tangent products have a lot of quirks , challenges , and have a high history of failure . I 'm not certain they are the best of breed to be matched with DoseEdge . They have been a partner for you since I have worked with the software in 2010 , but I have always had challenges with this specific hardware . Perhaps work with them to update the products and stability of the platforms , increase the number of USB drives , etc . based on customer feedback .	0

I do not feel that my leader treats everyone fairly . She has a few favorites on the team who always get the promotions , bigger bonuses , new work , etc . She does not treat everyone the same .

"1 . Stay flexible ! Product Marketing does a great job of planning , but we work in such a dynamic marketplace that things can change and new opportunities arise that are not in the plans . Sometimes it 's important to have the flexibility to change mid - stream if it 's in the best interest of our organization and the marketplace .  2 . Have clearer understanding of authority levels for various roles and assignments within Product Marketing . I often hear that decisions need to get pushed up the chain when it seems that a member of Product Marketing has been assigned to a program or event and should have that level of authority to make the call . Seems like we lose a lot of time "" going back "" to managers to get approval on decisions ."	0

Confluence provides a good level of functionality , however recent GUI changes have made it significantly harder to use . There is a general absence of visual cues about what functions are available , things fade our or disappear .  One of many examples is the search function . Typing a space leaving the window to do another task and coming back makes the user return to a completely white panel with NO information about what should be done . There is an assumption that the user never changes context and that if they do , they will come back quickly . The interface looks broken .	0

As a phramacist I had a superior experience with Alaris over Baxter . When I was developing my drug library the Alaris customer service was head and shoulders above their competition . I had an Alaris pharmacist call me and assist me with every step . Baxter basically had a technician walk me through a couple of examples and then left the rest for me to figure out on my own . I am an older pharmacist and I do not have any IT training . The assistance Alaris provided me for this issue was invaluable .	1
"There was an African American actress that came out behind a bar in one of the tavern reinactments . She asked ( Mostly ) the children , "" have you ever been afraid "" ... Repeatedly . She was implying rape at one point ... Not good for little kids ? She ended the whole thing by saying she did n't want to go in the next room in case there was "" a white protestant male there "" . You mean like my husband ? On the whole it was ridiculous and it was insulting and it took way too many historical liberties . , Especially the part that she 'd "" never been outside the house before "" . and was so afraid . We were her captives in a small room and it was insulting . We were four adult professional women and could n't get over how much W has changed in four years since our last business trip One of our group is returning next week with some children for a family trip . They are bagging Williamsburg and heading for bush Gardens instead  I absolutely love the museum however"	0
